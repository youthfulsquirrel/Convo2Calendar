We are very strict about the use of internet, especially the content. We go on a basis of not trusting. and especially they're not supposed to be online on their own. All screens of the laptop or the computer should be facing outwards, so that anybody who is walking by can see what's on the screen. What happens when you come across a scene and somebody is kissing? Then we don't watch that. We don't watch that scene anymore. None of the kids have actually stepped into a cinema before. Being the eldest, "

SPEAKER_00,0:32:35,0:33:05,29.11200000000008,I feel that he spends way too much time on the screen. This is the first time that Asher is live streaming.

SPEAKER_06,0:33:39,0:33:48,9.646999999999935,"be wrong. Why? I really didn't know that you were going to go live. As parents, we need to be very vigilant about what our children are doing online. "

SPEAKER_06,0:39:15,0:40:28,73.2159999999999,"Our kids don't go to public school. We actually educate them at home. Maybe some doubts from the elder generation, like Dan's mum also was quite fearful by their doing fine. The fact that both Dan and I were trained MOE teachers and choosing to homeschool actually is not because we have any commentary about the public school system. but more so because we want to take charge of our own children's education and having the autonomy to grow our children the way that we deem fit.

SPEAKER_06,0:40:54,0:41:17,23.299999999999727,They can do their own work while I have to cook lunch or sometimes I'm doing the laundry. It's really the book that teaches them and I come in as a guide. 
SPEAKER_04,0:41:17,0:41:29,11.727000000000317,The afternoons are spent playing and practicing music. 
SPEAKER_06,0:41:29,0:41:54,25.284999999999854,"Yeah, I really like homeschooling because I don't like to go outside. I don't like traveling. Do you feel like we are like other people wearing uniform and then you never wear? I don't like wearing the same thing every day. Quite boring. You still wear the same thing every day, right? Yeah. Do you think you're gonna study at home forever? "
SPEAKER_01,0:41:54,0:41:54,0.27999999999974534,No.

SPEAKER_01,0:42:03,0:42:10,7.585000000000036,you're going to school? Because I have to grow up anyway. 
SPEAKER_04,0:42:10,0:42:24,13.657999999999902,"In Singapore, homeschooling is allowed only if a child passes the primary school leaving examination, or PSLE, before 15 years old. "

SPEAKER_01,0:42:28,0:42:33,5.081000000000131,want to go to university. I want to stay home forever. But that's 
SPEAKER_06,0:42:33,0:42:55,21.78800000000001,"just what you're thinking now. Like when you get that age, you wouldn't think you want to stay home forever. Yeah. But now I want to stay. Can I take it out? No! If our children don't pass the PSLE, we would not be able to continue homeschooling them and they would be placed in a primary school. "
SPEAKER_04,0:42:55,0:43:10,15.528000000000247,"Passing isn't enough. There's a minimum standard that they have to reach. And that's why fourth child, Isaiah, is feeling the heat. He will be taking his PSLE later in the year. "
SPEAKER_06,0:43:10,0:43:31,20.294999999999618,"Chinese PSLE, you have to do oral. The subject I was really scared of was tennis. Because I can't speak Chinese and I can't write Chinese. I do know a bit but I'm not very good. "
SPEAKER_04,0:43:31,0:43:38,7.69800000000032,Isaiah's three older siblings did not meet the benchmark on their first try. 
SPEAKER_06,0:43:38,0:44:08,29.962999999999738,They all managed to clear at the second attempt. We have a different curriculum that we're using. So to suddenly get them to the PSLE track is kind of a switch for them. Mummy sometimes say we have to go this good if we fail. Just to scare us a little. Sometimes it terrifies me. 
SPEAKER_04,0:44:08,0:44:15,6.80600000000004,"The exams are in three months, and this will be Isaiah's second attempt. "
