I have two buckets of clarification. One, with regard to the standards of the PAP that Prime Minister spoke of. And second, with regard to the circumstances involving the departure of former Speaker Tan Chuang Jin and Cheng Li Hui. So there has been much public disquiet about the transmission of information surrounding Minister Yiswan's arrest by the CPIB, and separately on the affair between Speaker Tan Chuang Jin and MP Cheng Li Hui. This is particularly with regard to what the Prime Minister knew and what the Prime Minister did about it over a period of almost three years before coming clean on the matter. So in this term of government, the government has either been slow to clear the air or been less than upfront and forthright with Singaporeans when it had to deal with potentially embarrassing issues. I will give three examples that capture this point and my clarifications will be contained therein. Firstly, in May this year, the public was not informed forthwith that CPIB had been instructed to look into the ride-out road rentals by two Ministers. On 23 May, the Prime Minister released a statement stating SMTO Chih-Hen had been appointed to establish whether there had been any wrongdoing in the ride-out road rentals in order to maintain the highest standards of integrity in government. What the Prime Minister did not tell the public, but was made known by way of a statement from the Prime Minister's office written in the 3rd person on 28 June, was that the Prime Minister had directed the CPIB to investigate the ride-out road matter on 17 May, a full six days before his 23rd May statement, that omitted to mention that he had ordered a CPIB investigation into two of his ministers. The public came to know about the CPIB investigation more than a month later when investigations were completed, with CPIB confirming no criminal offence was disclosed. There is considerable public disquiet about the CPIB releasing a statement on 12 July which stated that Minister Iswaran was assisting with investigations, while omitting to disclose the fact that Minister Iswaran had been arrested a day before. In a parallel universe, there is a perception that if a Singaporean or a Singaporean company took such a cavalier and breezy approach with critical facts under today's PAP, they can expect to receive a pofma direction from a PAP Minister for perpetuating false statements of facts. has the Prime Minister inquired with the CPIB why it undertook such a course of action that brought unnecessary attention to the CPIB's processes and by extension even its impartiality involving the release of statements in the public interest. And if he did not, would he consider to do so? Thirdly, during COVID-19, the public was belatedly informed by a Minister in this House that his senior Cabinet colleagues were aware by October 2020 that previous Government assurances on trace together being solely used for contract tracing were effectively false statements of fact. Misrepresentations had hitherto been made by various Government Ministers and possibly in this House even before October 2020, and they stood uncorrected for months. The PAP Government took almost nine months before it disclosed to Singaporeans that the Singapore Police force off to collect trace-together data for an investigation in May 2020, even as the PAP continued to assert right through the rest of the year that trace-together was only to be used for contact tracing. Unlike as represented by the PM, these are not events that I quote, are clustered together, all coming at one go. Instead, they reveal a pattern of behaviour over a period of time of the PAP engaging in half-truths on matters of significant public interest. This behaviour goes a long way to explain why there is a real disquiet among Singaporeans today when the PAP invokes the memory of pioneer generation PAP leaders and talks about trust. So last month, the PM informed this House that he has to set the standards of what is ethical and what is proper, and that the PAP Government does not need an ethics adviser. Can I invite the Prime Minister to reconsider his position in view of the PAP's pattern of behaviour in this term of Government, especially when a potentially embarrassing issue comes up? I would like to suggest to the Prime Minister, in view of the complexity of Government and Governance today, it would not be embarrassing for the Government to consider the appointment of an ethics adviser. Sir, my clarifications on the Cheng Li Hui and Speaker Tan Chuang Jin meta-heist follows. The Prime Minister said, in comparing the hot mic issue with the inappropriate relationship that I quote, in comparison, the relationship was the more serious matter as he was the Speaker and she was an MP and there should not be a relationship, unquote. My question is, if the Prime Minister knew of the affair in 2020, why were Speaker Tan and Ching Lee Hui allowed to be on the same standing select committee of Parliament, namely the House Committee, after GE 2020, when the Prime Minister was already aware of the affair? Wouldn't their being on the same committee have resulted in more interactions between them than necessary, or given official reasons to be together? To this end, has the Prime Minister checked, since he knew of the affair in 2020, how many foreign trips have both Speaker Tan Chuan Jin and Cheng Liu He have been on at the taxpayers' expense, and was he not aware of them? My next question. The Prime Minister stated at the press conference in response to a reportous question that I quote, As for comparison with Michael Palmer, I think it depends on the situation of the case, and I said you have got to look at the circumstances, spouses, the family's condition, at how you manage this as sensitively as you can and yet do your duty, and it depends on the person's response as well as the specifics, so I do not think it is possible to make direct comparisons." I note the PM's reference to such sensitivity and eminently reasonable approach to take with delicate matters. However, this PAP selectively applies these standards, expecting Singaporeans to give the PAP the full benefit of doubt when its MPs foul up, while screaming blue murder when the opposition seek to make the same point. When former WP MP Raisa Khan revealed to the WP leaders that she was a rape victim, sensitivity was not even considered by the Committee of Privileges in accounting for the delay in addressing Raisa's lies to Parliament. The Prime Minister did not bat an eyelid in giving the Leader of the Opposition a sermon on Confucian ethics, morality and shame, even though at the material time, he would have been aware of the affair between Speaker Tan Chuang Jin and MP Cheng Li Hui. Can the Prime Minister please elaborate how the Chantranjian affair with an MP was different from the circumstances and conditions of former PAP Speaker Michael Palmer's affair with the People's Association member, which Senior Minister Theo Chi Hian then had said had to be dealt with, I quote, decisively? Finally, Why was there a need for so much time to plan for the care of Marine Parade and specifically Kabangan Chaiti residents? In other cases of resignations of PAP MPs such as Michael Palmer, President Halima, David Ong and Sena Minister Tharman, nothing close to that length of time was required. Could the Prime Minister detail for us what exact steps were taken between February and July 2023 to arrange for the care of Marine Parade residents? If that was the crux of the issue, then even if the planning for the care of Marine Parade residents was a proper justification for Tan Chuan Jin to remain a Marine Parade MP for five months, why was he not asked to step down as Speaker first and a new Speaker elected? If he had stepped down as Speaker, could he still not have continued as a Marine Parade MP until the arrangements were made? And before I round off, Mr Speaker, just one additional question. How were Tan Chuang Jin and Cheng Lihui counselled immediately after PM was informed about the affair in 2020? Did he personally counsel them? And how often did he check in on the status of the relationship thereafter? Thank you.

Before I ask Prime Minister to respond, I have given Leader of the Opposition some leeway. At this stage, we should be asking clarifications and not make speeches, and I request members going forward to remember that. Prime Minister? 

SPEAKER_01  516.493
Mr Speaker, let me deal first with a question of transmission of information. The Leader of the Opposition raises three issues, one of which has been extensively debated, in fact in 2020 during Covid, and I do not need to go back there again, which is the trace together and whether we should have announced earlier. when we discovered that the police were using it for their purposes. I think that has been completely explained close. That matter is done. As for CPIB statements, the CPIB does not investigate somebody unless there is a very serious reason to do so. The CPIB does not reveal that investigation generally until it has reason to believe that this investigation has to carry on, that it has to go somewhere. Therefore, in general, CPIB investigations are not, in the first instance, announced at all. If you had listened to Minister Chantun Singh, you would have heard that explained very clearly why, in general, the CPIB does not announce any investigations at all. And when I ask the CPIB to investigate, it is my prerogative, I do not have to tell anybody. What is important is that I did conduct an investigation and the investigation results were published. That is what matters. In the case of the 12th July statement, the reason why the CPIB said exactly what they said, if you listen carefully to Minister Chan Chun Singh, that explanation has been given, which was that they had to say what they felt justified in saying at that point. for operational reasons and to be fair to the persons involved and the Ministers, unless we have strong reason to do otherwise, will go along and we will not go beyond what the CPIB needs and is able to see. So I think in terms of transmission of information, we are pursuing a red herring. We could equally well ask, for example, when did the leader of opposition know about problems in his party, and what did he do about them? But those are matters which the Workers' Party will have to decide and will have to account to Singaporeans. And the BAP, we establish our own standards and we establish our own practices. As for the relationship between Tan Zhuangjin and Cheng Lihui and the questions on the House Committee and foreign trips, I think I will leave that to Leader to answer subsequently. On the difference between this case and the case of Michael Palmer and the PA staff, I think there are two differences. One, in Michael Palmer's case, it was involved the PA staff who worked in a team which supported Michael Palmer and other GRA advisors in Pasir Reis-Pongol GRC, Sub-Skwini Pasir Reis-Pongol GRC, and Pongol East SMC. And there is a reporting relationship there. Secondly, I think the specifics of the extramarital affair matter. As I explained just now, we have to look at how the families respond, what the other circumstances are, and that differs in every case. And I do not wish to go into specifics of how the EMAs are different, but I suffice to say they were different. As for Rai Sakan, that raises many issues and those issues are now have been exhaustively debated in the Committee of Privileges. The matter further problems have were recorded and reported by the Committee of Privileges and the matter has been referred to the police for investigations. So I would leave that to the police to pursue the matter and take it where it may. As for the time why I took so long, I counseled Tan Tran Jin at the beginning. I saw to it that Cheng Li Hui was also counseled at the beginning. They both agreed to stop. It did not happen. I do not wish to go beyond that and to take delve into the ins and outs of how it happened, but suffice it to say eventually it came to a break point. and they did not stop, and they had to go. I could have done it sooner. I should have done it sooner. I have explained that. Marine Parade was a consideration, but all things considered, I should have moved earlier. But the important thing is we move, and we brought it out, and we are open about it. When I was asked, I said, yes, I knew sometime after GE20, which is November 2020. I was open about it. If I hadn't said that, nobody would know that. And therefore, we clear the matter, and I think we account to Singaporeans. Leader of the House? 

SPEAKER_00  855.482
Mr Speaker, let me address the clarification which the Leader of the Opposition posed on parliamentary trips or official trips. Since the last general election, former Speaker Mr. Tan Chuan Jin had gone on five official overseas trips and three working trips. Working trips would be, for example, for the Olympic Games, etc. Of the five official overseas trips, only one was the one where Ms. Cheng Di Hui was present as well. So that was the two, that was the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly General Assembly, trip to Cambodia in 2022. There were 15 MP delegates in total for this trip. I understand that the Parliament Secretariat had organized since 2020 over eight, had organized 18 overseas parliamentary trips, including the IPA General Assembly one, in August, the upcoming one in 2023, and 60 MPs have participated in these visits across the years since 2020. So of the 18 visits, Ms Cheng Li Hui only participated in one overseas trip, and that is the AIPA General Assembly One held in Cambodia in 2022, and she did not attend other overseas trips, but she did not attend more overseas trips than other MPs. with regard to her selection for that trip, understand that the name was put up by the staffing officer and approved. With respect to the House Committee, there are several standing select committees. The names for the composition of the committees are put forward in the case of the PAP representation by myself. After the last general election, I had sought leader of the opposition's nominations for the opposition MPs because the rules provide that for standing select committees, the proportion of the ratio of majority MPs and opposition MPs should be roughly than the proportion that they represented in this House.

Leader of the opposition, Mr Pritam 

SPEAKER_02  990.997
Singh. Thank you, Speaker. Just the first point is a point of order. I respect what Speaker mentioned about not making extended speeches, but I was merely doing exactly what had transpired about one month ago when PAP MPs made extended speeches, specifically the Prime Minister, in the course of a ministerial statement. in response to a question, I believe, from backbencher Denise Poir. So I do seek your indulgence, Speaker. I wasn't going anything beyond what was already carried out by PAPMP in the course of a ministerial statement last month. I understand what Standing Order 23 says. I understand that the debate is not to ensue. in the course of, and they cannot be more than clarifications, but nothing special was undertaken by me in the course of me asking questions just now. I just want to put that on record. In terms of Prime Minister's replies, I think some of them still do not go into the details of matters that Singaporeans are actually quite concerned about, but I will address some responses which the Prime Minister gave. First, on Trace Together, that this has been extensively debated and so forth, and not particularly so. There are matters for which questions still arise. I think the Prime Minister made A statement well after the Trace Together issue was debated in Parliament. I think this was in March 2001, where he apologised and said, let me quote, and to be very clear about this matter. This was in an SD article, and this was the 14th of March, well after we had discussed the Trace Together. The Prime Minister came out to say, I think we made a mistake. The app was designed for contact tracing, but under the law, the police have powers to ask for information for criminal investigations. We should have said so up front. We did not, and we came out and said so. I must say this statement came after the storm of Trace Together had passed, and that just reinforces the earlier point that I spoke of. Prime Minister spoke about the leader of the opposition, what I did, what I knew. I think I've handled this in the course of my press conference, where I took 12 questions. When did the affair start? What information I had secured from the party's concern, and I believe I answered those fully. If the Prime Minister has specific questions for me, I will try and address them here. On the point of Raisa Khan, again, I was quite careful not to say anything which would get into the investigation per se, which is still ongoing. But the matter here is about the point the Prime Minister raised about sensitivity. The Prime Minister believes that it is appropriate to respond sensitively given the circumstances at hand. And the point I was making was we were dealing here with someone who said she had been raped. And I did not sense that sensitivity coming from the PAP at the time. And that's the point I was trying to make. On other matters, I think there will be further questions from Workers' Party MPs. I may come in and follow up with more questions in due course.
