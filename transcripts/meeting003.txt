00:00:00.480 have been infringed by a law or by the
00:00:03.840 actions of the public body he or she may
00:00:07.500 bring a legal challenge in court
00:00:09.780 hence it is possible for individuals who
00:00:13.620 argue that our existing laws and
00:00:15.719 policies on marriage are
00:00:18.539 unconstitutional
00:00:20.400 and seek a ruling from the court to that
00:00:23.039 effect
00:00:24.660 just as there have been challenges on
00:00:26.939 the constitutionality of 377a
00:00:30.180 there can also be challenges to laws and
00:00:33.420 policies related to marriage
00:00:37.320 the experiences of other jurisdictions
00:00:39.840 show The Perils of called LED change
00:00:43.620 most recently in August 2022 the Indian
00:00:47.579 Supreme Court observed that the
00:00:49.379 definition of a family unit should be
00:00:52.260 expanded to include homosexual
00:00:54.960 relationships as well as unmarried
00:00:57.960 Partnerships of same-sex relationships
00:01:01.460 relationships
00:01:03.180 this did not even arise from a challenge
00:01:05.519 of the definition of family per se
00:01:09.000 it arose from a case when an employer
00:01:12.600 denied a nurse her application for
00:01:15.659 maternity leave because she had already
00:01:18.420 taken leave to care for her husband's
00:01:20.820 children from a previous marriage
00:01:24.060 before this in 2018 the Indian Supreme
00:01:27.420 Court also struck down section 377 of
00:01:30.840 the Indian penal code which similarly
00:01:33.180 criminalized male homosexual Acts
00:01:36.659 we also see the same Trend in other
00:01:39.060 jurisdictions in the U.S for instance
00:01:41.659 controversial issues such as abortion
00:01:44.340 are litigated and re-litigated in their
00:01:46.920 courts when the courts decide things
00:01:49.860 change overnight with drastic social
00:01:52.939 repercussions that paralyze Society
00:01:56.130 [Music]
00:01:57.420 hence we are proactively safeguarding
00:02:00.360 the institution of marriage and related
00:02:02.340 laws and policies from being challenged
00:02:04.740 in court
00:02:06.240 this will allow the government to
00:02:08.160 continue to make laws and policies which
00:02:10.800 depend on heterosexual marriage as its
00:02:13.860 foundation
00:02:15.300 there have been questions on why the
00:02:17.340 government is intervening now
00:02:19.560 why repeal
00:02:21.540 why even amend the Constitution
00:02:24.660 perhaps we should leave things as they
00:02:26.819 are
00:02:27.660 let the courts decide when there is a
00:02:30.060 challenge
00:02:31.200 why do this now when there are other
00:02:33.780 issues of concerns such as cost of
00:02:35.879 living
00:02:37.080 that might be politically expedient
00:02:41.940 we acknowledge that there are indeed
00:02:44.099 other issues of conscience to
00:02:46.680 singaporeans such as cost of living
00:02:49.200 to use that as a reason for inaction
00:02:52.080 might be politically expedient but would
00:02:55.379 not be the right or responsible thing to
00:02:58.440 do
00:02:59.580 we have assessed that there is a
00:03:01.739 significant risk to our laws being
00:03:03.840 struck down
00:03:05.400 we cannot just ignore the legal risk
00:03:09.239 this amendment is necessary
00:03:12.060 and it's the right thing to deal with it
00:03:14.040 now and not delay
00:03:17.519 we have the Mandate and the
00:03:19.440 responsibility to govern and we must put
00:03:22.260 forward what we think is best for
00:03:24.659 Singapore and singaporeans
00:03:26.640 this includes making changes in a
00:03:28.980 calibrated and careful manner they may
00:03:32.459 not please everyone
00:03:36.300 we appreciate our Courts for exercising
00:03:38.940 wisdom and restrain on this matter
00:03:42.060 but a responsible government should not
00:03:44.879 leave the courts to Grapple with
00:03:47.340 controversial social issues
00:03:49.980 the role of the cause is to interpret
00:03:52.680 and apply the law it's not their
00:03:55.260 constitutional function to settle
00:03:57.780 political questions or rule on social
00:04:00.599 norms and values
00:04:02.519 is not their function to engage to the
00:04:05.580 political social ethical and other
00:04:09.360 dimensions of the issues
00:04:12.060 nor do the courts wish to do so
00:04:15.180 litigation is a zero sum adversarial
00:04:18.839 process with win-lose outcomes
00:04:22.560 it's unlike a political process where
00:04:25.259 the interests of stakeholders can be
00:04:27.300 considered
00:04:28.440 accommodation can be sought to reach
00:04:31.560 consensus
00:04:32.940 the costs also recognize that
00:04:35.460 controversial social issues are best
00:04:38.040 dealt with within the sphere of
00:04:40.380 Parliament
00:04:43.979 skill is what a responsible government
00:04:46.259 carrying out its duty to the people of
00:04:48.660 Singapore would introduce
00:04:51.600 it allows the political process to
00:04:54.060 balance different interests and
00:04:55.680 perspectives and does not pass the buck
00:04:58.919 to the courts
00:05:00.419 to rule on social issues which are best
00:05:03.600 dealt with via Parliament
00:05:06.660 let me now elaborate on the provisions
00:05:08.520 of the bill
00:05:09.780 there will be a new article 156 under
00:05:13.440 the general provisions of the
00:05:15.000 Constitution
00:05:16.680 cross one of the article makes clear
00:05:18.540 that Parliament can act to Define
00:05:21.080 regulate protect Safeguard support
00:05:24.560 Foster and promote marriage
00:05:27.840 for example
00:05:29.160 today the women's chapter in amla
00:05:31.280 defines civil and Muslim marriages
00:05:33.780 respectively and make clear that
00:05:36.479 same-sex marriages are not valuable
00:05:40.259 this Clause empowers Parliament to
00:05:42.600 continue to make an amend loss for these
00:05:45.120 purposes
00:05:46.199 the interpretation of other
00:05:47.940 constitutional Provisions must recognize
00:05:50.639 this for example in applying the
00:05:53.580 reasonable classification tests under
00:05:55.860 article 12 1. the course must recognize
00:05:59.160 that the promotion and safeguarding of
00:06:01.919 heterosexual marriage are legitimate and
00:06:05.220 permissible legislative objects
00:06:08.940 Clause 2 of the article applies to the
00:06:11.820 government and any Public Authority
00:06:14.699 it allows them to exercise their
00:06:16.500 functions to protect Safeguard support
00:06:19.380 Foster and promote marriage
00:06:22.319 this includes but it's not limited to
00:06:24.720 the following situations
00:06:26.639 hdb can Implement public housing
00:06:29.400 policies that give preference to married
00:06:31.919 couples to support Foster and promote
00:06:35.100 marriage
00:06:36.300 msf when they evaluate adoption
00:06:39.539 applications can recognize and take into
00:06:42.240 account the public policy goal to foster
00:06:46.259 and promote the formation of families
00:06:48.500 within the context of marriage as
00:06:50.880 defined in women's Charter and amla
00:06:54.060 curriculum of preschools and Moe schools
00:06:57.000 Center on the values that reflect
00:06:59.280 Singapore's mainstream society that is
00:07:02.460 marriage as being a union between a man
00:07:05.759 and a woman and children being born
00:07:08.220 within marriage and raised within such a
00:07:11.699 family construct
00:07:13.860 in the context of sexuality education
00:07:16.520 contents will be each appropriate this
00:07:19.740 means for example in preschools and
00:07:21.599 primary schools our curriculum will not
00:07:24.180 feature same-sex parents or same-sex
00:07:27.660 romantic relationships
00:07:30.240 at all the ages if introduced will focus
00:07:34.380 on educating our young to treat everyone
00:07:37.139 with respect and empathy but will not
00:07:40.560 promote same-sex relationships
00:07:43.620 imda in regulating media content is
00:07:47.699 Guided by principles that include
00:07:49.800 prevailing social norms and values that
00:07:52.680 are generally acceptable to members of
00:07:54.599 the public and protecting younger
00:07:57.000 audiences from each inappropriate
00:08:00.120 content
00:08:01.919 cross 3A provides that nothing in part 4
00:08:05.940 of The Constitution it sets out the
00:08:08.520 eight fundamental liberties will
00:08:11.220 invalidate any legislative definition of
00:08:14.400 marriage as a union between a man and a
00:08:17.580 woman
00:08:18.720 cross 3B and Clause 4 respectively
00:08:21.840 provides that laws and executive actions
00:08:24.780 cannot be invalidated by part four just
00:08:28.379 because they are based on a heterosexual
00:08:31.740 definition of marriage
00:08:35.219 Sammy asked why specify all the other
00:08:38.820 fundamental Liberties in part four and
00:08:41.339 not just article 12.
00:08:43.799 Mr Desmond will explain but broadly we
00:08:47.399 need article 156 to cover all of part
00:08:50.640 four so that it can apply to other
00:08:53.640 radical legal arguments that may be
00:08:57.180 brought in the future
00:08:58.980 and based on other articles in part four
00:09:02.580 article 156 will provide a strong Shield
00:09:06.959 however The Shield is also precise where
00:09:11.339 it only protects the heterosexual
00:09:13.440 definition of marriage and the laws and
00:09:16.200 policies that rely on this definition
00:09:20.399 in effect article 156 is an exception to
00:09:24.540 the fundamental liberties
00:09:26.940 there are already such exceptions
00:09:30.000 for example article 39a empowers the
00:09:33.720 legislature to create group
00:09:36.180 representation constituency or grcs to
00:09:39.779 ensure minority representation in
00:09:42.420 Parliament
00:09:43.760 article 39a3 of the Constitution exams
00:09:48.180 any law regarding grc's from being
00:09:50.940 invalidated on the ground of
00:09:53.279 inconsistency with article chop
00:09:57.060 article 1491
00:09:59.880 prevents the internal Security Act from
00:10:02.399 being invalidated by articles 9 11 12 13
00:10:06.420 or 14.
00:10:08.519 article 9 6 creates exceptions from
00:10:11.760 article 9 for the criminal law temporary
00:10:14.459 Provisions act and for rehabilitative
00:10:17.339 detention for drug addicts
00:10:20.040 article 14 2 also has limits on article
00:10:23.459 14 where one's rights to freedom of
00:10:26.100 speech assembly and Association is
00:10:29.820 subject to public order morality or
00:10:33.120 security of Singapore
00:10:35.940 article 123 makes clear that the right
00:10:38.820 to equal protection does not apply to
00:10:41.160 laws that regulate personal law or to
00:10:44.279 laws and practices that restrict office
00:10:46.560 or employment connected with Affairs of
00:10:49.740 any religion
00:10:52.260 each case involves a balance between the
00:10:55.680 fundamental Liberties and countervailing
00:10:58.500 interests
00:11:00.060 in the case of article 1563 and 4 we've
00:11:03.600 struck the balance in favor of having
00:11:05.519 the strongest protection
00:11:07.680 for the heterosexual definition of
00:11:10.079 marriage adopted by Parliament
00:11:12.779 and the ability of Parliament and the
00:11:15.720 government to make laws and policies on
00:11:18.600 the basis of this definition
00:11:21.300 this reflects the importance of
00:11:23.220 heterosexual marriage in our society
00:11:26.459 Samuel commented that this is an Oster
00:11:29.100 clause and could be subject to Legal
00:11:31.740 challenges to be clear the nature of
00:11:34.920 article 156 is not an Oster Clause
00:11:38.480 instead it provides exceptions or limits
00:11:42.000 to the fundamental Liberties as
00:11:44.459 mentioned such exception already exist
00:11:48.540 today
00:11:50.519 let me now turn to another aspect that
00:11:52.500 have come up in our engagements they
00:11:54.839 have been wide-ranging and we have heard
00:11:57.720 from singaporeans across various Walk of
00:12:00.000 Life
00:12:00.839 I I first want to take the opportunity
00:12:03.240 to appreciate the different groups of
00:12:05.399 singaporeans who have written in and
00:12:07.920 whom we have engaged before and after
00:12:10.140 PM's announcements
00:12:12.779 these engagements include those with
00:12:14.640 religious leaders Grassroots leaders
00:12:16.920 union leaders LGBT groups social sector
00:12:21.000 professionals youth groups and members
00:12:23.820 of the public
00:12:25.380 many have written in to share their
00:12:27.300 views on this matter singaporeans have
00:12:29.760 generally understood the need to respect
00:12:33.320 graciously and mutually accommodate each
00:12:36.660 other's views and support the
00:12:38.940 government's approach
00:12:40.800 gay people appreciate the repeal of
00:12:43.860 section 3778
00:12:45.899 but express some apprehension of the
00:12:48.480 implications of the Constitutional
00:12:50.519 Amendments
00:12:52.079 those in favor of the status quo have
00:12:54.839 constructively shared their views and
00:12:57.480 emphasized the need to safeguard the
00:12:59.399 institution of marriage others whom we
00:13:02.639 have engaged such as leaders from the
00:13:04.500 community also support the proposed
00:13:06.839 approach to keep the heterosexual
00:13:09.060 definition of marriage while repealing
00:13:11.940 377a
00:13:14.519 many are concerned about cancer culture
00:13:17.300 religious freedom discrimination faced
00:13:20.700 by those with differing views on this
00:13:22.740 issue and the narrowing public space
00:13:26.160 to speak openly about it
00:13:28.500 these are important feedback and
00:13:30.180 concerns that Mr Desmond Lee will also
00:13:32.820 address when he speaks
00:13:35.579 some Express the wish to go further than
00:13:38.880 what we are proposing protecting the
00:13:41.399 definition of marriage in our current
00:13:43.800 laws they want the definition of
00:13:46.800 marriage to be enshrined in the
00:13:49.260 Constitution
00:13:51.240 you understand that these calls come
00:13:53.220 from a sincere belief in the sanctity of
00:13:55.860 marriage and reflects a genuine worry
00:13:59.160 that the institution of marriage
00:14:01.399 marriage might be changed in the future
00:14:04.380 to include same-sex marriage
00:14:07.860 I thank those who have spoken up for
00:14:10.260 taking a stand on what they think is
00:14:12.720 best for Singapore
00:14:14.820 but the government has to govern with
00:14:17.040 principle
00:14:18.360 our view is that elevating marriage to
00:14:21.600 the same level as fundamental rights in
00:14:24.660 the Constitution would not be
00:14:26.760 appropriate
00:14:28.200 as explained earlier the Constitution
00:14:30.600 should be for functions such as
00:14:32.399 sovereignty and our systems system of
00:14:35.519 governance
00:14:36.839 the institution of marriage and family
00:14:39.060 is the Bedrock of society but to elevate
00:14:42.480 it to the same level as fundamental
00:14:44.880 rights would fundamentally change the
00:14:48.060 whole complexion and schema of the
00:14:50.820 Constitution
00:14:52.680 there are many important laws and
00:14:55.079 principles that are not in the
00:14:57.120 Constitution
00:14:58.139 but are in Acts of parliament for
00:15:00.779 example
00:15:01.680 national service in the enlistment Act
00:15:04.860 corruption is in the prevention of
00:15:07.740 corruption act zero tolerance to drugs
00:15:10.860 is in the misuse of drugs Act
00:15:13.500 home ownership is in the hdb act
00:15:17.160 the definition of marriage is and will
00:15:19.920 remain in a woman's Charter
00:15:22.040 interpretation act and amla
00:15:26.480 importantly this government will not use
00:15:31.079 our current super majority in Parliament
00:15:34.500 to tie the hands of the future
00:15:37.019 Generations
00:15:38.820 hence the Constitutional Amendment will
00:15:41.940 not prevent future governments elected
00:15:44.760 by the people from amending the legal
00:15:47.760 definition of marriage by a simple
00:15:50.760 majority in Parliament
00:15:52.620 should they choose to do so
00:15:55.440 this is how democracy works
00:15:58.920 but what you want to be clear is that
00:16:01.800 the definition of marriage and related
00:16:03.779 policies should not be determined by the
00:16:06.899 courts
00:16:08.760 in fact the Constitutional Amendment
00:16:10.860 provides greater protection than today
00:16:13.019 not just for the definition of marriage
00:16:15.779 but also related policies
00:16:19.560 BMS said that this government has no
00:16:22.079 intention of changing the definition of
00:16:24.480 marriage nor the policies that rely on
00:16:27.240 this definition
00:16:28.860 DPM Lawrence Wong as 4G leader has also
00:16:32.040 said that the government will not change
00:16:34.260 them under his watch
00:16:36.420 if the pap were to win the next general
00:16:39.480 election
00:16:40.980 I reiterate these assurances in this
00:16:44.220 house
00:16:45.899 ultimately whether marriage in Singapore
00:16:48.839 will remain as a union between a man and
00:16:51.360 a woman depends on the consensus in
00:16:54.120 society shaped by the values we all own
00:16:59.220 so long as Society strongly supports the
00:17:01.620 current definition of marriage no
00:17:03.959 government will change the definition
00:17:06.599 if societies support erodes no amount of
00:17:10.500 legislation or constitutional
00:17:13.020 Arrangement will prevent change
00:17:16.799 on our part the government is doing all
00:17:19.799 we can to promote social norms and
00:17:23.339 values aligned to the current definition
00:17:25.679 of marriage
00:17:27.299 but it's not something the government
00:17:28.919 can accomplish on its own
00:17:31.679 the transmission of social values to the
00:17:33.960 next generation is something
00:17:35.700 singaporeans practice within their own
00:17:38.520 families and with their loved ones
00:17:41.760 sir this approach in this the approach
00:17:45.480 in this bill reflects Singapore's unique
00:17:48.419 approach
00:17:49.679 Singapore is a secular state but a
00:17:52.980 multi-religious and multi-racial Society
00:17:56.760 we are one of the most diverse Societies
00:17:58.919 in the world
00:18:00.179 there are different ethnic and religious
00:18:02.280 groups each with their own practices
00:18:05.120 Customs Norms convictions and beliefs
00:18:10.200 this diversity and Harmony make
00:18:12.900 Singapore unique and it's a key part of
00:18:16.260 our Singaporean identity
00:18:18.900 it's not easy to hold such a diverse
00:18:21.240 Society together
00:18:22.740 we are a young nation and all of us have
00:18:25.260 taken great care and effort to preserve
00:18:27.960 the Harmony and peace that we have
00:18:30.780 we have been able to live together
00:18:32.400 peacefully because we learn to
00:18:34.919 understand
00:18:36.360 go beyond our own perspectives and
00:18:39.780 graciously accommodate one another
00:18:43.020 this has been the Singapore
00:18:45.660 because we recognize what is best for
00:18:48.780 our society
00:18:58.080 some may wish to maximize their own
00:19:00.720 positions
00:19:02.039 but when this happens it unsettles
00:19:04.980 others and cause resistance which will
00:19:07.980 lead to further pushback and split our
00:19:11.039 society apart
00:19:13.020 Singapore will not come out well in the
00:19:15.539 end
00:19:16.740 it's therefore important that certain
00:19:18.660 groups do not push beyond what is
00:19:21.720 acceptable to our society
00:19:24.059 in most cases Society needs time to
00:19:28.260 adjust to change
00:19:30.000 especially on issues that can polarize
00:19:32.520 us
00:19:33.480 we may have different ideals and
00:19:35.700 perspectives but we are all singaporeans
00:19:38.340 and I hope this is an identity we can we
00:19:41.640 continue to be proud of
00:19:43.799 we Forge a majority based on what we
00:19:46.200 share in common and what unites us
00:19:49.740 this is why the government has
00:19:51.419 consistently emphasized the importance
00:19:54.059 of preserving our common space fostering
00:19:57.419 good citizens and upholding the
00:20:00.000 principle of equality regardless of race
00:20:02.880 language or religion
00:20:04.980 only then can we be United as
00:20:07.500 singaporeans to achieve progress as a
00:20:09.660 nation
00:20:10.919 we are fortunate that our religious
00:20:12.840 leaders understand the context of our
00:20:15.480 diverse society and their communities
00:20:18.059 trust the government to treat all Faith
00:20:20.600 completely impartially
00:20:23.820 while they are honest
00:20:25.559 and constructive in providing their
00:20:27.660 views on methods of concern in their
00:20:30.179 religious communities
00:20:31.919 the trust that laws and policies are in
00:20:34.740 the National interest and not to favor
00:20:37.080 one religion over another
00:20:40.380 this approach works because the
00:20:42.480 government on its part is fair and
00:20:45.000 considers all perspectives
00:20:47.160 including those who are religious as
00:20:50.039 well as those who are not religious
00:20:52.679 no one can act only for the interest of
00:20:56.700 a few segments of the society
00:20:58.799 without regard for the rest
00:21:01.260 maintaining this approach requires
00:21:03.360 wisdom and courage from everyone
00:21:07.500 as we see in other societies it's very
00:21:10.679 easy to yield to sectarian or tribalist
00:21:13.799 views
00:21:14.880 even if you do not win
00:21:17.400 you will be popular with them
00:21:19.740 but we need to guard against this
00:21:22.559 we also continue to protect all from
00:21:25.440 scorn and harm
00:21:26.880 this includes homosexuals who are
00:21:29.520 members of society
00:21:31.140 our kids our kid
00:21:34.799 our homosexuals have a place in our
00:21:37.559 society and space to live their lives in
00:21:40.320 Singapore in our families we should not
00:21:42.900 exclude or love our loved ones who are
00:21:45.840 homosexuals
00:21:47.280 in our communities they like other
00:21:50.159 singaporeans have access to education
00:21:52.620 and employment to health care and Social
00:21:55.140 Services to protection from violence and
00:21:58.620 harassment
00:22:00.240 workplace discrimination against
00:22:01.919 homosexuals for reasons unrelated to the
00:22:05.340 ability to do the job it's a bridge of
00:22:08.159 the principle of fair and merit-based
00:22:11.039 employment
00:22:12.140 outlined in the chapati guidelines on
00:22:15.299 Fair Employment Practices
00:22:17.940 but on marriage and family most
00:22:20.700 singaporeans wish to retain current
00:22:23.580 norms
00:22:24.600 as I've mentioned before it is the
00:22:27.240 government's View
00:22:28.500 as well
00:22:30.480 as a society regardless of your views on
00:22:33.900 marriage family or homosexuality
00:22:37.380 no one should feel unsafe
00:22:40.700 expecting your views of fear being
00:22:43.860 canceled
00:22:45.000 bullied or discriminated against
00:22:48.600 is dangerous for our society if we do
00:22:51.059 not learn to respect others who hold
00:22:53.460 differing views from us
00:22:55.620 this threatens the common space and
00:22:58.320 Singapore will not be able to progress
00:23:01.080 as a cohesive Society
00:23:05.580 sir Emily

00:26:11.460 foreign
00:26:15.900 I believe that many of us appreciate
00:26:18.360 this secular approach that has provided
00:26:20.820 singaporeans security and safety living
00:26:24.000 together and the freedom to practice our
00:26:27.600 religion
00:26:29.039 religious group can continue to preach
00:26:31.320 about homosexuality according to their
00:26:33.779 religious beliefs however for all the
00:26:37.140 diverse groups that may be for or
00:26:39.480 against homosexuality no one can violate
00:26:43.080 the loss of the land or instigate
00:26:45.419 violence or intimidation towards others
00:26:48.299 or particular group
00:26:50.400 we are protected by the constitutional
00:26:52.860 right to be free to profess practice and
00:26:56.159 propagate our religion
00:26:57.960 but this right is not absolute
00:27:01.500 subject to considerations of public
00:27:03.779 order public health of morality a
00:27:06.960 singaporeans must also have respect for
00:27:09.480 each other as fellow citizens in
00:27:12.000 exercising this right
00:27:15.120 I want to make clear that our pro-family
00:27:18.000 values and positions are not a result of
00:27:20.700 a majority majoritarian or religious
00:27:23.820 approach
00:27:24.900 this one that we share in common as
00:27:26.880 singaporeans and what this government
00:27:28.500 believes in and stands for
00:27:31.200 it is how we have come so far and will
00:27:33.960 enable our society to perpetuate and
00:27:37.260 flourish in the future
00:27:39.120 it's in the public interest and not the
00:27:41.940 narrow interests or of a specific
00:27:44.820 religious group
00:27:47.460 our community leaders many of whom we
00:27:49.919 have engaged on this issue also support
00:27:52.500 our pro-family approach
00:27:54.840 and have helped families over the years
00:27:57.559 they will continue to have a critical
00:27:59.880 role in maintaining social cohesion and
00:28:02.520 railing support for our family values
00:28:05.039 such is a system that ensures the safety
00:28:08.539 survival and success of Singapore
00:28:12.000 no one group can have everything they
00:28:14.880 want
00:28:15.779 all the time
00:28:17.520 the preferences of other singaporeans
00:28:19.799 matter too
00:28:21.799 spmsc we're seeking a political
00:28:25.279 accommodation that balances different
00:28:28.320 legitimate views and aspirations among
00:28:31.500 singaporeans
00:28:33.539 so we are taking a calibrated approach
00:28:36.299 through this Constitutional Amendments
00:28:38.460 which seeks to address the concerns that
00:28:40.860 people may have on whether a repeal will
00:28:44.100 cause a sudden shift
00:28:46.740 however it's also done in a way not to
00:28:48.900 tie the hands of a future Parliament
00:28:51.179 above all we want to ensure that
00:28:53.940 Parliament should be the main platform
00:28:56.100 to discuss sensitive issues
00:28:59.039 and not the courts
00:29:01.260 we must also redouble our effort to
00:29:03.600 sustain this system that's brought about
00:29:05.580 peace and Harmony in our multi-religious
00:29:08.640 and multi-ethnic Society
00:29:11.220 as we advocate for what we believe in
00:29:14.580 let us
00:29:17.700 also do it respectfully and in the
00:29:21.240 knowledge that we United by our
00:29:23.580 Singapore identity
00:29:54.059 Minister masagos has explained the
00:29:56.340 reasons
00:29:57.419 for the Constitutional Amendments
00:29:59.940 I will now speak on the repeal of
00:30:01.980 section 377a of the penal code
00:30:06.260 we thought very carefully before moving
00:30:09.120 on the repeal of this section
00:30:12.120 over the past year we have engaged
00:30:14.220 extensively
00:30:15.480 with various groups some several times
00:30:20.580 those we spoke with include religious
00:30:23.940 leaders
00:30:25.340 LGBT groups Community leaders people who
00:30:29.100 want heterosexual marriage as a social
00:30:31.200 Norm youth groups members of the public
00:30:34.500 who are written to us and many others
00:30:37.919 for many who
00:30:41.059 did not believe that section 377a should
00:30:44.880 be repealed
00:30:46.440 their main concerns were about the
00:30:49.799 consequences of the repeal of section
00:30:51.840 377a what will happen after the section
00:30:56.220 is repealed and not because they thought
00:30:59.100 that gay sex between men should in
00:31:02.580 itself be criminalized
00:31:05.880 in considering whether we should repeal
00:31:08.520 section 377a I will cover three areas
00:31:12.419 first the historical context of section
00:31:15.360 377a
00:31:16.919 second the political compromise that has
00:31:20.039 been struck in Singapore
00:31:21.899 and third the reasons for now moving on
00:31:25.500 the repeal
00:31:27.419 first the historical context
00:31:29.880 why do we have to look at history
00:31:32.220 we need to understand why and how
00:31:35.279 section 377a became part of the law
00:31:38.940 whether it was a deliberate considered
00:31:41.940 decision or perhaps more of happenstance
00:31:45.080 and that provides a context for the
00:31:47.640 discussion
00:31:48.980 as members will know section 377a makes
00:31:52.919 it an offense for a male person whether
00:31:55.500 in public or private
00:31:57.360 to commit an act of growth indecency
00:31:59.640 with another male
00:32:01.200 the term gross indecency can include
00:32:03.659 both non-penetrative and penetrative
00:32:06.539 success
00:32:08.279 the section was introduced in 1938 when
00:32:11.220 Singapore was a British colony
00:32:13.320 attorney general Howell moved the bill
00:32:15.840 in 1938 he said that section 377a was
00:32:19.679 being introduced to bring our law in
00:32:22.559 line with the UK criminal law
00:32:24.899 thus to understand the Genesis of
00:32:27.240 section 377a
00:32:29.100 we will need to look at the original UK
00:32:31.440 law passed 137 years ago which is
00:32:35.520 section 11 of the UK criminal law
00:32:38.100 Amendment act or ukcl
00:32:41.159 thank you
00:32:43.380 section 377a is almost a word for word
00:32:46.620 copy of section 11 of the ukcl
00:32:49.919 and section 11 of the ukcl
00:32:52.679 was passed in 1885 its origin is quite
00:32:56.340 upscale and we have not been able to
00:32:58.679 find any background which explains why
00:33:02.039 this section was introduced and made
00:33:05.399 into law
00:33:06.600 what we did find was that it was
00:33:08.940 introduced in the UK House of Commons at
00:33:11.760 2 30 a.m in the morning
00:33:13.679 with very few MPS were present it's a
00:33:16.980 last-minute amendment to an entirely
00:33:19.500 unrelated bill
00:33:21.120 and the unrelated bill was meant to
00:33:24.059 protect women and girls and for the
00:33:26.580 suppression of brothels
00:33:28.380 at that point that unrelated Bull on
00:33:30.840 protection of women and girls had been
00:33:33.299 through a four year long process it had
00:33:36.539 endured a long debate in Parliament and
00:33:39.480 it had passed the House of Lords without
00:33:41.159 Amendment
00:33:42.960 the unrelated Amendment on male
00:33:44.940 homosexuality was introduced by a member
00:33:47.340 of parliament Mr Henry labusha his
00:33:50.220 motives for introducing section 11 into
00:33:52.260 the bill on protection of women and
00:33:54.600 girls are unclear one school of thought
00:33:58.559 is that Mr La Boucher in had intended it
00:34:02.159 to be a wrecking amendment to derail and
00:34:05.640 discredit the entire bill on protection
00:34:08.159 of women and girls
00:34:10.020 he had that reputation in fact
00:34:13.080 he had introduced another amendment to
00:34:14.940 the same bill and another Member of
00:34:17.219 Parliament said that Mr labasha couldn't
00:34:19.619 have been serious in introducing that
00:34:21.540 other Amendment
00:34:22.918 academics who have studied the matter
00:34:24.719 have pointed to Mr La boucher's habitual
00:34:27.659 parliamentary
00:34:29.599 subscribe
00:34:31.339 obstructionist technique he would make
00:34:34.440 spoiling amendments to discredit bills
00:34:36.480 that had been introduced
00:34:38.760 another school of thought is that Mr La
00:34:40.980 Boucher was fiercely homophobic and so
00:34:43.619 he introduced the amendment
00:34:45.859 himself gave an explanation in
00:34:48.179 Parliament
00:34:49.260 for why he introduced section 11
00:34:51.540 and his explanation raises more
00:34:53.699 questions
00:34:54.719 then it answers he said that his
00:34:57.900 amendment was to protect any person from
00:35:00.000 an assault
00:35:01.380 of the kind dealt with under Section 11
00:35:04.099 whether the person was above or under
00:35:06.660 the age of 13 years
00:35:08.339 after that short explanation he did he
00:35:10.980 said he did not think it was necessary
00:35:13.020 to discuss the proposal at any length
00:35:15.240 because the government was willing to
00:35:17.220 accept it
00:35:18.359 if we take at face value what Mr La
00:35:20.880 Boucher said in Parliament in 1885 then
00:35:23.760 the purpose of section 11 was to prevent
00:35:26.460 an indecent assault by one male against
00:35:29.460 another male
00:35:31.859 the provision he introduced which was
00:35:33.960 passed into law was however much wider
00:35:36.720 than that including those where the sex
00:35:39.540 acts were done between consenting male
00:35:41.579 adults
00:35:42.660 thus the amendment that was introduced
00:35:44.700 was quite different from the explanation
00:35:47.040 that was given indeed the explanation he
00:35:50.280 gave is somewhat contrary and the
00:35:52.560 amendment was dealt with in Parliament
00:35:54.180 in less than four minutes
00:35:56.160 there was no discussion about the fact
00:35:58.079 that the provision criminalizes
00:35:59.720 consenting male homosexual Behavior even
00:36:03.180 though the stated purpose was to
00:36:05.099 criminalize sexual assaults
00:36:07.740 people have spent time trying to work
00:36:09.599 out the motives of Mr La Boucher and the
00:36:12.240 reasons the UK parliament passed the
00:36:14.040 amendment some have suggested that the
00:36:16.680 MPS were fatigued by the late hour it
00:36:19.260 was 2 30 a.m and that the MPS had been
00:36:21.960 worn out by the long debate on the bill
00:36:23.880 to protect women and girls which as I
00:36:26.940 said earlier had taken four years and
00:36:29.280 that the MPS had just wanted to get on
00:36:31.140 with it to let the amendment through
00:36:33.720 this is a Genesis the background to the
00:36:36.359 law passed in 1885
00:36:38.400 which has gone on to impact the lives of
00:36:40.920 tens of thousands of people and has
00:36:43.560 caused much controversy and intense
00:36:46.079 debate in many countries
00:36:47.880 Mr Speaker with your permission may I
00:36:50.880 ask for the distribution of a folder
00:36:52.619 which contains an access one to seven
00:36:54.359 that I am going to refer to yes please
00:36:56.760 members may also access the annexes
00:36:58.859 through the sjpal mobile app
00:37:02.220 in addition to section 11 of the ukcl
00:37:04.619 the UK also had three other offenses
00:37:06.780 which were used sometimes to prosecute
00:37:08.820 homosexual conduct the first was sodomy
00:37:12.359 sodomy was first criminalized under the
00:37:14.640 buggery Act of 1533 during the reign of
00:37:17.820 King Henry VII
00:37:19.380 the reason this law was passed is linked
00:37:22.619 to a specific important historical event
00:37:25.500 in British history
00:37:27.720 and not because
00:37:29.940 there was any specific intention to make
00:37:32.220 sodomy a crime
00:37:34.079 I have an Annex one set out the
00:37:36.240 background in context to how and why the
00:37:39.540 buggery Act was passed into law
00:37:42.900 prior to 1533 sodomy was considered an
00:37:46.680 offense punished by the church
00:37:48.780 it was tried in the ecclesiastical
00:37:51.240 courts in other words not a crime
00:37:53.760 defined by the state it was an offense
00:37:56.339 in a religious context to be dealt with
00:37:59.339 by the church
00:38:00.900 members will know that Henry VII broke
00:38:03.180 with a church in Rome started the Church
00:38:05.460 of England with him as the head of the
00:38:07.260 church
00:38:08.040 he wanted to reduce the power of the
00:38:09.960 church and one of the ways he did that
00:38:12.839 was to reduce the power of the
00:38:17.060 ecclesiastical courts and he did that by
00:38:19.920 converting many of the church's Canon
00:38:22.560 laws into secular laws the buggery Act
00:38:26.339 was one such law that was brought over
00:38:28.680 from the Canon laws and made into
00:38:31.079 secular criminal law
00:38:32.820 that way the king's courts will deal
00:38:34.859 with the matter and the church's
00:38:36.900 jurisdiction was removed
00:38:39.000 what happened thereafter is also useful
00:38:41.040 to know
00:38:42.060 his daughter Mary was an Ardent Catholic
00:38:44.700 so when she became Queen in 1553 she
00:38:48.420 abolished the buggery act and moved it
00:38:50.220 back to the ecclesiastical courts
00:38:52.680 Queen Elizabeth another of Henry's
00:38:55.020 daughters succeeded Queen Mary five
00:38:56.880 years later in 1558 there were questions
00:38:59.940 on her legitimacy and her claims to the
00:39:02.460 throne
00:39:03.420 she took several steps to establish her
00:39:05.640 legitimacy and one of the steps she took
00:39:08.400 was to reduce the role of the church by
00:39:10.980 moving the laws
00:39:12.720 out of Canon laws and making them
00:39:15.720 secular laws to show that she was
00:39:18.060 following in her Father's Footsteps so
00:39:20.579 the buggery act thus became secular
00:39:22.560 criminal law again
00:39:24.119 so when you go through this history into
00:39:26.040 the origins of the offense of sodomy we
00:39:29.099 see that it was introduced as part of a
00:39:31.260 power struggle between Henry and the
00:39:34.079 Catholic church and not because of Any
00:39:36.480 view that sodomy per se ought to be
00:39:39.839 criminalized
00:39:41.460 I'm setting out this historical context
00:39:43.740 factually not suggesting that sodomy
00:39:46.140 ought not to have been criminalized the
00:39:49.500 second act that was used to prosecute
00:39:51.359 homosexual conduct was the offense of
00:39:53.599 solicitating or import tuning in public
00:39:56.640 places for immoral purposes
00:39:59.220 this was first introduced under the
00:40:01.079 vagrancy Act of 1898
00:40:03.119 it was initially intended to Target pims
00:40:05.640 men who left off the earnings of female
00:40:08.160 prostitutes
00:40:10.320 in practice however the legislation was
00:40:12.720 used almost exclusively to prosecute men
00:40:15.240 who engaged in homosexual conduct in
00:40:17.339 public
00:40:18.140 though male homosexuality was not
00:40:21.060 discussed in Parliament when the bill
00:40:23.400 was first introduced
00:40:25.140 the third offense was the offense of
00:40:27.060 indecent assault against males this was
00:40:30.180 first introduced
00:40:31.619 under the offenses against the person
00:40:33.599 Act 1861. and the offense criminalized
00:40:37.020 homosexual acts committed against males
00:40:39.180 without consent
00:40:41.160 it was introduced as part of a wider
00:40:43.320 Omnibus Bill consolidating all offenses
00:40:46.800 against a person and was included in the
00:40:50.520 same provision as an offense of
00:40:52.200 attempting to commit sodomy
00:40:54.780 unfortunately the provision and its
00:40:57.599 overlap with existing homosexual
00:40:59.339 offenses and even male homosexuality
00:41:02.520 were not discussed at all during the
00:41:05.040 Parliamentary debates
00:41:06.720 so what we see is that these Provisions
00:41:09.119 when they were first introduced there
00:41:11.760 was no substantive deliberation on
00:41:15.300 whether there was indeed a need
00:41:17.700 to criminalize homosexual Behavior and
00:41:21.300 it looks more like happenstance than a
00:41:25.020 deliberate decision
00:41:26.579 regardless the criminal Provisions were
00:41:28.920 retained as part of UK's criminal law
00:41:30.540 until the 1960s the UK government
00:41:33.119 appointed a committee known as the
00:41:34.800 wolfenden committee in August 1954 to
00:41:38.460 review the laws relating to homosexual
00:41:40.260 offenses that committee published a
00:41:43.380 report in 1957 the committee stated that
00:41:46.800 it was not charged to enter into matters
00:41:48.540 of private moral conduct except in so
00:41:51.300 far as they directly affected the public
00:41:53.820 good
00:41:54.720 the committee was only concerned with
00:41:56.700 whether homosexual Behavior should be
00:41:58.920 dealt with under criminal law the
00:42:02.579 committee concluded that the function of
00:42:05.160 criminal law was three-fold
00:42:07.859 one to preserve public order and decency
00:42:10.520 two to protect the citizen from what is
00:42:13.800 offensive and injurious and three to
00:42:17.040 provide sufficient safeguards against
00:42:19.560 the exploitation and Corruption of
00:42:22.380 others
00:42:23.400 in their View
00:42:25.200 it was not the function of criminal law
00:42:27.240 to intervene in the private lives of
00:42:29.640 citizens or to seek to enforce any
00:42:32.880 particular pattern of behavior further
00:42:35.400 than it was necessary to carry out these
00:42:37.619 three functions the committee took the
00:42:39.900 view that homosexual activities in
00:42:41.760 private should not be criminalized
00:42:44.579 committee stated and I quote unless a
00:42:47.940 deliberate attempt to be made by Society
00:42:50.160 through the agency of the law
00:42:52.440 to equate the sphere of crime with that
00:42:55.140 of sin there must remain a realm of
00:42:58.319 private morality and immorality which is
00:43:02.400 not the Lost business
00:43:04.440 to say this is not to condone or
00:43:07.200 encourage private immorality
00:43:09.780 moral conviction or instinctive feeling
00:43:12.440 however strong is not a valid basis for
00:43:15.960 overriding the individual's privacy and
00:43:18.839 for bringing within the Ambit of the
00:43:20.819 criminal law
00:43:21.960 private sexual behavior of this kind
00:43:25.440 committee accepted that homosexual
00:43:27.359 Behavior between males could have a
00:43:29.040 damaging effect on family life let me
00:43:31.740 pause there I think many singaporeans
00:43:33.300 believe this as well and we must
00:43:35.339 acknowledge these feelings and beliefs
00:43:37.980 the committee however emphasized that
00:43:40.800 this damage was no greater than many
00:43:42.720 other activities which was since
00:43:45.480 and may be considered immoral but were
00:43:49.200 not otherwise criminal offenses
00:43:52.140 the debate continued through the late
00:43:54.540 1950s and early 1960s
00:43:57.240 law students may recall the well-known
00:43:59.220 debate between Lord Dublin and Professor
00:44:01.319 Hart on the offenden report for members
00:44:04.740 reference I have summarized the points
00:44:06.359 they made in nx7
00:44:08.579 eventually Lord Devlin who had argued
00:44:10.800 for the criminalization of shared
00:44:12.540 morality also said that private
00:44:15.480 consensual homosexual sex between adults
00:44:18.960 should be decriminalized in 1967 the UK
00:44:23.460 Parliament voted to decriminalize
00:44:25.200 private consensual homosexual sex
00:44:27.720 between two adults by that time
00:44:30.359 religious groups such as the Church of
00:44:32.220 England and the Methodist conference and
00:44:34.980 members of both houses had publicly
00:44:37.560 expressed support for a change
00:44:40.140 the members of the House of Lords who
00:44:42.000 spoke in support of decriminalization
00:44:43.800 included the Lord Chancellor he was a
00:44:46.740 Speaker of the House of Lords and the
00:44:48.060 head of the Judiciary as well as a
00:44:50.880 Lord Archbishop of Canterbury who was
00:44:54.000 the leader of the Church of England and
00:44:55.680 the head of the global Anglican Union as
00:44:58.920 well as various other Bishops
00:45:00.839 I would like to briefly cite the speech
00:45:02.940 made by the Lord Archbishop or
00:45:04.680 Canterbury he stated up front that he
00:45:07.260 believed that homosexual Acts were wrong
00:45:09.900 he went on to say that the case for
00:45:12.300 amending the law rested on reason and
00:45:15.180 Justice and on considerations of the
00:45:17.760 good of the community
00:45:19.740 he said to amend the law was not to
00:45:22.560 condone the wrongness of the ACT
00:45:26.280 it however put such acts in the realm of
00:45:29.760 private moral responsibility
00:45:32.400 he believed that the law is it stood
00:45:34.460 gave a sense of Injustice and bitterness
00:45:38.040 which helped morality no more
00:45:40.920 than would a law which made fornication
00:45:43.200 a crime
00:45:44.760 he further agreed with his predecessor
00:45:46.800 that having such a law created fair
00:45:49.619 secretiveness and despair in gay persons
00:45:52.920 who did not die to seek help
00:45:55.440 in case they expose themselves and their
00:45:58.020 friends to criminal proceedings
00:46:00.240 I would add that not all religious
00:46:02.280 groups were in favor of the change
00:46:04.680 some such as a church of Scotland in the
00:46:07.440 Church of Ireland and the Baptist Church
00:46:09.000 objected to the reform
00:46:11.160 in 2003 all of the United Kingdom's laws
00:46:14.579 that specifically criminalized male
00:46:16.640 homosexual being Behavior including the
00:46:20.460 offense of gross indecency who are fully
00:46:23.280 repealed
00:46:24.300 before I move on from the UK I would
00:46:26.160 like to highlight the context of
00:46:28.020 Northern Ireland
00:46:29.220 Northerly Island was and is part of the
00:46:31.859 UK however the partial decriminalization
00:46:34.920 of homosexual conduct in the UK in 1967
00:46:38.700 only applied to the mainland and did not
00:46:42.240 apply to Northern Ireland
00:46:43.800 Northern Ireland's path to
00:46:45.420 decriminalization started instead from
00:46:48.359 the courts
00:46:49.500 after 14 years in 1981 the European
00:46:52.260 Corps of Human Rights found that
00:46:54.740 criminalizing private homosexual conduct
00:46:57.540 between men was an unjustified
00:47:00.480 interference with a person's right to
00:47:02.819 respect
00:47:03.780 for his private life and was a breach of
00:47:06.900 the European convention on human rights
00:47:10.319 UK was bound by their decision in UK
00:47:13.140 Parliament decriminalized private
00:47:15.300 consensual homosexual conduct between
00:47:17.220 adults in Northern Ireland in 1982
00:47:19.700 however at that time Northern Ireland
00:47:22.200 Society was deeply religious largely
00:47:24.720 conservative and the majority of the
00:47:27.240 population of Northern Ireland opposed
00:47:29.640 the decriminalization including most of
00:47:32.220 the Protestant churches as well as the
00:47:34.500 Roman Catholic Church the bill was
00:47:36.480 opposed by all of
00:47:38.300 the 12 Northern Ireland MPS in the UK
00:47:41.280 Parliament but nonetheless it passed
00:47:43.920 through both houses by majority vote
00:47:46.619 Northern Ireland's experience shows how
00:47:49.619 a court decision can force a change even
00:47:52.680 though a society is not ready for such
00:47:55.020 change and I'll come back to this later
00:47:58.619 today homosexuality remains a deeply
00:48:01.440 divisive issue around the world
00:48:04.020 this is true even Within more
00:48:07.140 religiously homogeneous communities such
00:48:09.119 as a church of England and the global
00:48:11.280 Anglican Church
00:48:12.660 if you look at the Anglican communion it
00:48:14.819 comprises 42 member churches it's a
00:48:18.060 third largest Christian communion after
00:48:20.640 the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox
00:48:22.920 churches for decades there has been a
00:48:26.460 strong difference of views within the
00:48:29.099 Anglican communion on whether same-sex
00:48:31.800 unions can be legitimized and blessed
00:48:34.560 and whether a persons living in same-sex
00:48:36.960 relationships can be ordained some
00:48:39.720 Anglican churches in the global North
00:48:41.339 such as the United States and Canada are
00:48:45.300 increasing increasingly supportive of
00:48:47.520 homosexuality
00:48:48.900 they allow same-sex marriages and
00:48:51.720 ordained persons in same-sex
00:48:53.460 relationships however several Anglican
00:48:56.339 churches from the global South
00:48:59.339 do not agree with this approach and this
00:49:01.920 has resulted in the creation of the
00:49:04.619 global Anglican future conference or
00:49:06.839 gefcon
00:49:07.920 in 2008 led by the more conservative
00:49:11.520 Anglican Bishops and leaders
00:49:13.920 the Church of England LGBT issues have
00:49:16.500 also been the subject of intense debate
00:49:18.420 for decades I mentioned earlier that the
00:49:21.060 Church of England had supported the
00:49:23.099 partial decriminalization of homosexual
00:49:25.260 conduct in the UK in 1967 but actually
00:49:29.280 within the Church of England there was
00:49:31.079 no consensus church was more or less
00:49:33.540 equally split on the issue and it was
00:49:35.280 put to a vote of its 735 members 155
00:49:40.800 voted in favor
00:49:42.560 138 voted against and the rest either
00:49:45.780 have centered themselves or abstained so
00:49:49.020 there continues to be strong differences
00:49:51.000 in viewpoints on this issue as members
00:49:53.760 may have seen from recent media reports
00:49:56.520 so what does all of this show first that
00:49:59.099 even within a single religious community
00:50:01.160 it is difficult to agree on the right
00:50:04.140 answer assuming there is one on the
00:50:07.020 issue of homosexuality
00:50:09.540 second that homosexuality is a topic
00:50:12.000 that continues to raise strong
00:50:13.740 viewpoints third that if we do not
00:50:16.680 handle this carefully homosexuality can
00:50:19.319 be a deeply divisive issue even among
00:50:22.619 those who share a common belief
00:50:28.260 some of the international media Outlets
00:50:30.180 that report on these issues often gloss
00:50:32.940 over these differences they gloss over
00:50:35.220 the problems that societies face don't
00:50:37.859 understand the need to deal with these
00:50:39.660 issues sensitively with understanding
00:50:43.079 they present views as if they are
00:50:45.599 settled and that anyone who has a
00:50:47.880 negative view of male homosexuality is a
00:50:50.640 bigger and is wrong
00:50:52.619 if you look at the U.S it is considered
00:50:54.660 more accepting of LGBT rights than many
00:50:57.780 other countries but the country is
00:50:59.700 internally split over this issue for
00:51:02.400 example in the Republic Republican
00:51:04.200 states of Florida and Texas
00:51:06.660 there remain strong objections to LGBT
00:51:09.119 rights the Republican party of Texas
00:51:11.400 recently adopted
00:51:13.760 anti-lgbt positions into their party
00:51:15.960 platform they State and I quote
00:51:18.680 homosexuality is an abnormal lifestyle
00:51:21.059 choice
00:51:22.200 we believe there should be no granting
00:51:24.300 of special legal entitlements or
00:51:26.579 creation of special status for
00:51:29.280 homosexual Behavior regardless of state
00:51:31.980 of origin
00:51:33.420 and we oppose any criminal or civil
00:51:36.180 penalties against those who oppose
00:51:38.280 homosexuality out of Faith conviction or
00:51:41.460 belief in Traditional Values no one
00:51:44.040 should be granted special legal status
00:51:46.740 based on the lgbtq plus identification
00:51:51.059 but other Republicans have different
00:51:52.920 views on homosexuality a survey of more
00:51:55.740 than 22 000 people
00:51:57.660 by the public religion Research
00:52:00.119 Institute in March of this year
00:52:02.400 found that 48 percent
00:52:05.960 supported same-sex marriage and 50
00:52:08.579 percent are posted these were persons
00:52:11.940 who identified themselves as Republicans
00:52:15.420 if we look at say Italy you know I will
00:52:18.660 not go through in detail I have set out
00:52:20.280 what has been happening in Italy in nx2
00:52:22.740 you will see the divisions
00:52:25.260 I have laid out examples of how within
00:52:27.599 the same religion the same denomination
00:52:30.000 the same churches within the
00:52:32.040 denomination and in wider Society within
00:52:34.859 some Western countries even those who
00:52:37.559 are often described as liberal
00:52:39.780 the issues remain deeply divisive
00:52:42.839 to be clear it is not the exact same
00:52:45.300 issue in all these communities in some
00:52:47.760 the division is about homosexuality in
00:52:49.740 itself in some it is about the roles of
00:52:52.500 LGBT people for example in church
00:52:55.380 ordination in others it is other related
00:52:58.859 issues like same-sex unions that are
00:53:01.740 divisive
00:53:02.940 let me now say something about global
00:53:05.760 trends around the world in several
00:53:08.280 countries as well as in jurisdictions
00:53:11.220 and territories which are not quite
00:53:13.319 countries
00:53:14.579 several have decriminalized their
00:53:16.319 version of section 377a
00:53:18.680 including commonwealth countries and
00:53:20.880 Southeast Asian countries
00:53:22.680 some have decriminalized it through the
00:53:24.780 Parliamentary process some have had the
00:53:27.720 section 377a equivalent struck down by
00:53:30.660 the courts but there are also some
00:53:32.760 countries which continue to keep the
00:53:34.440 criminal laws Mr Speaker with your
00:53:36.960 permission
00:53:38.640 oh I would like to display some slides
00:53:40.859 on the screen
00:53:41.880 slides one and two of nx3 show the
00:53:45.839 countries that are their countries and
00:53:47.460 territories
00:53:48.540 and jurisdictions that have
00:53:49.980 decriminalized homosexuality and those
00:53:51.839 which have not done so because not all
00:53:54.720 the places in these two slides are
00:53:57.300 countries
00:53:58.619 and slide three shows the same for Asian
00:54:01.880 States and places and jurisdictions
00:54:05.339 we can see that across the world there
00:54:07.740 are different approaches even though
00:54:10.200 there is a trend towards
00:54:11.819 decriminalization in Singapore we look
00:54:14.520 carefully at International Trends but we
00:54:16.800 don't simply follow such Trends we chart
00:54:19.440 our own path based on what we believe is
00:54:22.260 in our own best interests and we have
00:54:24.660 made it clear to foreign governments and
00:54:26.280 companies that these are political
00:54:28.680 social and moral choices
00:54:31.200 for singaporeans to decide and that they
00:54:34.020 should not interfere for example last
00:54:37.020 year in 2021 the U.S embassy co-hosted a
00:54:40.619 webinar on LGBT rights with a
00:54:43.079 Singaporean LGBT organization
00:54:45.900 MFA spoke to the Embassy to remind them
00:54:48.420 not to interfere in our domestic
00:54:50.400 politics more recently in August
00:54:53.760 this year
00:54:55.079 U.S House speaker
00:54:57.359 Nancy Pelosi issued a statement when she
00:54:59.640 was in Singapore asking business groups
00:55:02.099 to support
00:55:03.540 the LGBT community in Singapore
00:55:07.440 mha issued a statement reminding foreign
00:55:09.660 businesses to be careful
00:55:11.520 about advocating on socially divisive
00:55:13.920 issues in Singapore
00:55:15.420 we would also say to U.S politicians who
00:55:19.079 feel very strongly about these issues
00:55:21.260 that perhaps they should first try and
00:55:23.640 persuade the people in Texas and other
00:55:25.859 such places
00:55:27.800 before the issue statements in Singapore
00:55:32.579 in Singapore section 377a was
00:55:35.280 substantively debated in Parliament
00:55:37.619 15 years ago in 2007 during the second
00:55:40.800 reading of the penal code Amendment bill
00:55:44.160 over the course of two days 16 MPS and
00:55:46.740 nmps came out to speak on Section 3778
00:55:49.619 to argue for and against its retention
00:55:51.859 it was a long debate I have summarized
00:55:55.559 the different positions taken by the MPS
00:55:57.240 and nmps in nx4
00:55:59.640 prime minister spoke and stated the
00:56:02.099 government's position he said that
00:56:04.200 singaporeans as a whole remained largely
00:56:06.359 conservative
00:56:07.500 majority wanted to keep Singapore a
00:56:10.200 conservative Society with heterosexual
00:56:12.480 stable families
00:56:14.520 but at the same time there was a growing
00:56:16.680 science-based evidence that sexual
00:56:18.660 orientation was substantially inborn
00:56:22.140 gay people must have a place in society
00:56:24.420 and they are entitled to their private
00:56:26.460 lives but there were still very
00:56:28.740 different views amongst singaporeans on
00:56:30.720 whether homosexuality was acceptable or
00:56:34.079 morally right
00:56:35.460 thus LGBT advocacy should not set the
00:56:38.460 tone for the rest of Singapore Society
00:56:41.339 we will try and maintain a balance said
00:56:44.099 the prime minister to uphold a stable
00:56:46.319 Society with traditional heterosexual
00:56:49.020 Family Values but with space for
00:56:52.140 homosexuals to live their lives and
00:56:54.599 contribute to society
00:56:56.880 he added that we would continue to
00:56:58.559 retain section 377a but not proactively
00:57:02.280 enforce it it was a very Singaporean way
00:57:06.180 of dealing with the situation
00:57:08.099 which best fitted with the way our
00:57:10.920 society was
00:57:15.599 PM also reminded MPS that section 377a
00:57:18.960 was inherited from the British and that
00:57:22.200 Asian societies which were similar to
00:57:24.240 ours did not have such laws not in Japan
00:57:27.300 not in China
00:57:29.099 not in
00:57:30.540 Taiwan but if we forced the issue it
00:57:33.839 would divide and polarize our society it
00:57:36.660 would lead to even less space for the
00:57:38.520 gay community in Singapore therefore it
00:57:41.040 was better to let the situation evolve
00:57:43.020 gradually
00:57:44.339 it was a compromise
00:57:46.380 it was better
00:57:49.260 and it has worked for Singapore in the
00:57:51.599 past 15 years we managed to maintain
00:57:54.119 some Harmony while
00:57:56.579 many other societies have become deeply
00:57:58.920 divided on these issues over the same
00:58:01.319 period
00:58:02.579 now let me now move on to explain why we
00:58:05.700 propose to repeal section 377a
00:58:09.180 at this point
00:58:10.800 there are two main reasons
00:58:12.780 first it is the right thing to do and
00:58:15.599 Society is more ready now for the repeal
00:58:17.819 second
00:58:19.319 there is a significant legal risk that
00:58:22.740 the courts will strike down section 377a
00:58:25.140 if we left it alone and did nothing
00:58:28.800 let me deal with the first reason in
00:58:31.319 some religions homosexuality is
00:58:33.119 considered a sin as members heard
00:58:35.940 earlier some sins are crimes but not
00:58:39.359 every sin is a crime our position in
00:58:42.359 Singapore is for a conduct to be a crime
00:58:45.000 there should generally be a public order
00:58:47.460 of public interest issue it's broadly
00:58:50.220 similar to the position set out by the
00:58:52.559 wolfenden committee which I referred to
00:58:54.180 earlier basic function of criminal law
00:58:56.700 is to preserve public order and decency
00:58:58.700 to protect citizens from what is
00:59:01.140 offensive and injurious and to provide
00:59:03.480 sufficient safeguards against
00:59:05.240 exploitation and Corruption by
00:59:07.859 Corruption of others
00:59:10.020 in Singapore like in many other places
00:59:12.000 it's generally not the function of
00:59:14.040 criminal law to intervene in the private
00:59:16.020 lives of citizens
00:59:17.880 as we consider this question it is also
00:59:20.280 important to understand what will remain
00:59:23.040 criminalized even if section 377a is
00:59:26.700 repealed
00:59:27.839 first non-consensual sexual assault by
00:59:31.260 males against other males will obviously
00:59:34.440 be an offense and it's a serious offense
00:59:37.079 two sexual acts committed by males
00:59:40.140 against young persons again a serious
00:59:43.140 offense regardless of consent three
00:59:46.559 sexual acts between two males committed
00:59:48.900 in public that offends public decency
00:59:51.839 will remain an offense
00:59:54.420 the maximum penalty for the first two
00:59:56.520 offenses is in fact more severe then the
00:59:59.819 maximum penalty under Section 377a and
01:00:03.000 rightly so this government takes an
01:00:05.579 extremely Stern view against all
01:00:08.299 non-consensual sexual offenses in risk
01:00:12.119 and in respect of sexual offenses
01:00:14.160 against minus
01:00:16.079 the only thing that will no longer be an
01:00:18.180 offense after the repeal is consensual
01:00:20.640 male adult homosexual conduct
01:00:24.540 conducted in private
01:00:26.760 such conduct does not raise Law and
01:00:28.980 Order concerns
01:00:30.299 the time has come for us to remove
01:00:33.240 section 377a it accumulates and hurts
01:00:37.140 gay people
01:00:38.220 most gay people do not cause harm to
01:00:40.920 others they just want to live peacefully
01:00:43.380 and quietly and be accepted as part of
01:00:46.440 society
01:00:48.420 the same as any other Singaporean
01:00:50.940 they are a family of friends our
01:00:52.859 colleagues they deserve dignity respect
01:00:55.980 acceptance
01:00:57.900 they do not deserve to be stigmatized
01:01:00.780 because of their sexual orientation
01:01:03.720 to a gay person even if section 377a is
01:01:07.799 not enforced it is there memorialized in
01:01:11.700 law is thought hanging over his head a
01:01:15.420 daily remember reminder that every time
01:01:18.240 he engages in private sexual activity
01:01:20.480 behind closed doors in the sanctity of
01:01:23.700 his bedrooms he is nevertheless a
01:01:26.520 criminal
01:01:27.660 we have to ask is it fair that gays have
01:01:30.299 to live in this way
01:01:31.740 this is not something we should accept
01:01:33.799 even if we personally disagree with
01:01:36.540 homosexuality
01:01:37.980 so I will say let us start to deal
01:01:42.000 with these divides heal these divides
01:01:45.420 remove their pain
01:01:47.400 section 377a should no longer be in our
01:01:50.579 books
01:01:51.720 repealing section 377a makes it clear
01:01:54.299 that gay people are not criminals
01:01:56.640 compared to 2007
01:01:58.859 we are now at a stage where our society
01:02:01.140 can accept the repeal of section 377a
01:02:06.059 from of engagements we see that most
01:02:08.400 singaporeans accept that sex between men
01:02:10.920 should not be a crime even those who
01:02:13.619 want to retain section 377a do not want
01:02:16.680 to see it actively enforced
01:02:19.380 but as has been stated in and out of
01:02:21.599 Parliament we must and we will take
01:02:24.240 steps at the same time to deal with the
01:02:26.940 possible consequences of the repeal the
01:02:29.579 Constitutional amendment is one big step
01:02:32.040 there are others
01:02:33.540 because some consequences would be
01:02:35.640 unacceptable to a significant section of
01:02:38.640 our society
01:02:40.140 the government has explained its
01:02:41.880 position about dealing with consequences
01:02:44.180 members can refer to nx5 for a summary
01:02:47.099 over what the Prime Minister Deputy
01:02:50.040 Prime Minister Lawrence Wong various
01:02:52.020 Ministries
01:02:54.359 as well as I have said on the matter
01:02:58.619 now let me move on to the second reason
01:03:00.540 for the repeal and that is that
01:03:04.020 leaving section 377 a alone in the books
01:03:08.520 carries a significant legal risk
01:03:18.839 the courts May strike down section 377a
01:03:21.839 in the future
01:03:23.099 and if the courts strike down section
01:03:24.980 377a it will be a binary process they
01:03:29.040 cannot deal the courts cannot deal with
01:03:30.960 all the legitimate concerns about the
01:03:33.839 consequential effects of the repeal
01:03:36.839 which many are concerned about
01:03:39.540 why do we say there is a significant
01:03:41.460 legal risk of section 377a being struck
01:03:44.160 down
01:03:47.400 let me take members through two part of
01:03:49.859 appeal decisions
01:03:51.420 the ca has dealt with Section 3778 twice
01:03:55.680 in the last 10 years
01:03:57.660 first in Lim Ming song versus attorney
01:04:00.720 general decided in 2014 and second in
01:04:03.900 transit key was as attorney general
01:04:06.420 decided earlier this year 2022.
01:04:09.720 both decisions took quite different
01:04:11.880 approaches on two issues first a
01:04:14.520 procedural issue and second a
01:04:16.140 substantive issue in limang song the
01:04:18.839 court made a procedural decision in 2012
01:04:21.420 and the substantive decision in 2014.
01:04:26.040 the procedural decision was on standing
01:04:28.440 by the whether the applicants had Locust
01:04:31.440 standby or standing whether they were
01:04:34.079 entitled to make the application
01:04:36.839 the court of appeals said that the
01:04:39.660 applicants did have local stand eye
01:04:42.000 because there was a real and credible
01:04:44.940 threat of future prosecution
01:04:47.339 the ca further added that even if no
01:04:50.760 prosecution was contemplated
01:04:53.400 the applicants could bring the action
01:04:55.079 they had standing because of the very
01:04:57.720 existence of a law
01:05:00.299 which is unconstitutional
01:05:03.059 members should know
01:05:05.099 the CA in 2012 said the very existence
01:05:08.460 of 377a gave Locust and I for an
01:05:12.720 applicant
01:05:14.040 to make an application
01:05:16.140 on the substantive issue the court of
01:05:19.020 appeals said
01:05:20.579 that section 377a did not contravene
01:05:23.700 either article 9 or articles 12 of The
01:05:26.819 Constitution
01:05:28.020 on article 12 the court of appeal
01:05:29.940 applied a legal test known as a
01:05:32.339 reasonable classification test to come
01:05:34.619 to that conclusion
01:05:36.000 it said that section 3778 satisfied that
01:05:39.780 test and did not violate article 12. the
01:05:43.440 ca therefore dismissed the application
01:05:45.299 in Lim Ming Tsung on the substantive
01:05:47.940 basis that section 377a was not
01:05:51.359 unconstitutional
01:05:53.040 even though the applicants had local
01:05:55.980 standby to bring the challenge
01:05:59.220 section 377a was then challenged again
01:06:01.559 in the course in tan senki it was again
01:06:03.780 argued that 377a contravened articles 9
01:06:07.319 and 12 in addition 377a was also
01:06:10.680 challenged on the ground that it
01:06:12.900 contravened article 14 of the
01:06:15.599 Constitution which guaranteed the right
01:06:17.760 of freedom of speech and expression
01:06:19.920 court of appeal dismissed the challenge
01:06:22.440 how and why the ca came to that decision
01:06:25.200 and what it said
01:06:27.599 is important this time in tanzan key the
01:06:31.680 appeal was dismissed on procedural
01:06:33.480 grounds on the basis that the applicants
01:06:36.000 lacked local standi to challenge section
01:06:38.819 377a
01:06:40.440 and the court deliberately did not rule
01:06:42.660 on one of the substantive grounds first
01:06:45.420 on the procedural issue
01:06:47.160 the ca reversed itself on the Locust and
01:06:49.500 I point and took a different view from
01:06:52.020 its earlier decision in liming song
01:06:55.079 the ca said that there was no Locus
01:06:57.299 standi because the AG had said that
01:07:00.480 absent other factors there would
01:07:03.059 generally be no prosecution under
01:07:04.680 Section 377a
01:07:06.539 where the conduct was between two
01:07:08.460 consenting adults in a private place on
01:07:11.760 this basis the ca said that section 377a
01:07:14.339 was unenforceable until the AJ gave
01:07:17.280 clear notice that he intended to enforce
01:07:20.160 377a
01:07:22.440 thus
01:07:23.700 into the ca the applicants did not face
01:07:25.619 any real or credible threat or
01:07:27.420 prosecution under 377a and so they did
01:07:30.780 not have standing to bring the case
01:07:33.299 in limang song the court of appeal had
01:07:36.660 settled the very existence of 377a
01:07:40.559 was enough to give local stand I in tan
01:07:43.680 sinki the court took a diametrically
01:07:45.720 opposite View
01:07:47.700 members will note one court of appeal
01:07:50.400 can disagree with another court of
01:07:52.020 appeal
01:07:53.520 I'll come back to this
01:07:55.619 it is also significant to see what the
01:07:57.780 court of appeal had to say in dancing
01:08:00.180 key on the substantive issue as to
01:08:02.760 whether section 377a was
01:08:04.619 unconstitutional
01:08:06.720 the ca
01:08:08.280 actually did not need to give any view
01:08:10.640 on the substantive merits of the
01:08:13.079 challenge because it had already said
01:08:15.480 that the applicants could not bring the
01:08:17.279 case but it nevertheless went on to give
01:08:20.160 its views and serve with your permission
01:08:23.100 we can show in a slide some basic points
01:08:25.979 they made
01:08:26.939 the ca first considered the arguments in
01:08:30.179 relation to article 9 of the
01:08:31.500 Constitution on life and personal
01:08:33.479 Liberty and said quite clearly that 3778
01:08:36.960 did not violate article 9.
01:08:39.660 the court then considered whether 377a
01:08:42.060 contravened article 14.
01:08:44.819 on freedom of speech and expression and
01:08:47.399 it said no there was no contravention
01:08:50.460 then it considered article 12 the equal
01:08:52.799 protection clause
01:08:54.479 on this the C8 took a different view
01:08:57.000 from its previous decision in liming
01:08:58.799 song
01:08:59.698 and the ca said that there were two ways
01:09:02.040 to apply the reasonable classification
01:09:04.259 test
01:09:05.279 one
01:09:06.960 is the approach adopted
01:09:09.120 in Lim Ming song in 2014 and the second
01:09:13.080 was the approach adopted in a 2021 case
01:09:16.020 inside Sohail
01:09:17.819 the court of appeal went into a detailed
01:09:20.460 comparison between the two approaches
01:09:22.920 Cod said that if the site suhail
01:09:26.219 approach is taken
01:09:27.960 then section 377a might fall a full a
01:09:31.620 full of the reasonable
01:09:33.600 classification test
01:09:36.299 if you see what the court of appeal is
01:09:38.100 said in red
01:09:42.660 one can then conclude that it said the
01:09:46.979 differential embodied in 377a namely
01:09:49.439 male male sex acts lacks a rational
01:09:52.140 relation to legislative legislative
01:09:54.299 object of reflecting societal
01:09:56.640 disapproval of homosexual conduct in
01:09:59.340 general or safeguarding public morality
01:10:01.920 generally
01:10:05.699 in plain language what this means is
01:10:08.219 section 377a is probably
01:10:10.520 unconstitutional if the site suhail test
01:10:13.920 is to be applied
01:10:15.660 even though the court of appeal was
01:10:17.820 careful to say
01:10:19.380 section 377a might be unconstitutional
01:10:22.440 if the test inside soil was applied
01:10:26.219 lawyers will know at least some lawyers
01:10:28.739 will know that the court of appeal is in
01:10:30.420 fact in subsequent cases applied the
01:10:33.000 sides to health test
01:10:35.520 after the decision interns and key the
01:10:38.760 court of appeal is applied the side
01:10:40.320 swell test an approached in two other
01:10:43.260 cases in May and August of this year in
01:10:46.620 May 22
01:10:49.699 and in August in tereshu's case what
01:10:53.520 does all of this mean in plain language
01:10:55.280 it means that if another constitutional
01:10:57.780 challenge against section 377a is
01:11:00.120 brought
01:11:01.020 before the court
01:11:03.420 the site so Health test is likely to be
01:11:05.820 applied
01:11:06.719 and if that test is supplied section
01:11:09.560 377a is likely to be struck down on the
01:11:13.080 grounds that it breaches article 12 of
01:11:15.659 The Constitution
01:11:17.940 say well we accept what the ca has said
01:11:22.159 this year also said there is no local
01:11:24.540 standard to bring the challenge
01:11:26.400 so as long as the Attorney General
01:11:28.320 maintains a current position and does
01:11:30.780 not reassert the right to prosecute
01:11:32.640 cases under 377 a then there should be
01:11:36.120 no risk that 377a would be found
01:11:39.620 unconstitutional because no one would
01:11:42.239 have standing to challenge it in the
01:11:44.159 first place
01:11:46.140 taking such a review I can give an
01:11:48.000 analogy it's like letting a small boat
01:11:51.239 sailing choppy Waters surrounded by
01:11:53.340 rocks and hoping that the boat won't
01:11:55.500 crash into the rocks there are two major
01:11:58.260 risks in taking this view first just
01:12:02.040 because the applicants in Thomson key
01:12:04.080 did not have standing does not mean that
01:12:06.960 no one else will have standing in a
01:12:09.360 future case for example
01:12:11.699 persons who had been convicted in the
01:12:13.679 past under 377a
01:12:15.780 they may well have a case for standing
01:12:18.420 and I don't want my speech to be read as
01:12:20.340 giving a right to people it's my view
01:12:23.760 but such persons May well have a case
01:12:26.400 for standing by arguing that their
01:12:28.920 rights have been violated and therefore
01:12:31.500 that they have sufficient interest to
01:12:33.060 challenge the constitutionality of 377a
01:12:37.260 they will not be able to directly reopen
01:12:39.659 their convictions but they can ask for
01:12:42.420 3778 to be struck down on the basis that
01:12:45.360 this will give them Vindication and the
01:12:47.580 Very fact that they had been convicted
01:12:49.080 under a unconstitutional legislation
01:12:51.900 gives them the standing and to allow
01:12:54.900 them to redress the hurt of their
01:12:56.760 conviction
01:12:57.840 and if you look at tan senki the ca was
01:13:00.480 very careful to circumscribe what it
01:13:03.060 said about who had Locust and I
01:13:05.280 it expressly stated that its decision on
01:13:07.679 local stand I will not for example
01:13:10.199 prevent police from investigating
01:13:12.420 conduct under 377a
01:13:14.820 if you look at the parts in red
01:13:17.340 in reality there is a broad Universe of
01:13:19.739 cases where the police may have to
01:13:21.360 investigate because before investigating
01:13:23.280 they might not know exactly what the
01:13:25.980 facts are so you can't rule out the
01:13:28.140 possibility that in some situations a
01:13:29.940 person involved in the investigations
01:13:31.500 brings a challenge and you cannot rule
01:13:34.500 out that a future Court could find this
01:13:36.420 to be sufficient grounds for a person to
01:13:38.820 have local stand eye to challenge 377a
01:13:42.300 and of course there is the other risk
01:13:44.640 the ca can always change its mind on
01:13:46.739 Locust and I just as it did
01:13:48.840 uh between
01:13:51.900 liming song and tanzan Ki
01:13:56.159 it changed its mind precisely on this
01:13:58.500 point of locust and I
01:14:00.120 so we cannot proceed
01:14:02.219 in the belief that the ca will will
01:14:05.520 certainly not change its views in the
01:14:07.199 future
01:14:09.120 in September this year I took part in a
01:14:11.159 law Forum organized by the Singapore
01:14:12.780 Academy of law and the law society which
01:14:14.940 discussed the implications of tan senki
01:14:17.040 and the legal risks surrounding 377a
01:14:20.280 there was a panel discussion moderated
01:14:22.440 by the dean of the SMU Law School panel
01:14:25.440 and audience included the dean of suss
01:14:28.020 law school legal Scholars from our law
01:14:30.719 faculties presidents of the Law Society
01:14:33.659 past and present and Senior Council and
01:14:37.080 now distinguished and senior legal
01:14:39.840 experts panel and the audience were
01:14:42.179 pretty unanimous on the legal risks
01:14:44.760 surrounding section 377a
01:14:47.219 in light of Thompson key
01:14:49.500 members can refer to nx6 for key points
01:14:52.260 and Views that were shared at the law
01:14:53.699 forum
01:14:55.140 as the
01:14:58.340 the attorney general and I looked
01:15:01.140 carefully at the tanzenki judgment and
01:15:03.840 as the Prime Minister said during
01:15:05.219 National Day rally the AJ and I have
01:15:08.040 advised the government that in a future
01:15:10.500 Court challenge
01:15:12.000 there is a significant risk of section
01:15:14.780 377a being struck down
01:15:17.880 so let us be clear
01:15:19.800 one after the tanzenkiel judgment
01:15:24.179 section 377a is that significant risk of
01:15:28.080 being struck down in a future Challenge
01:15:30.500 and two
01:15:32.460 we cannot simply hope that the point on
01:15:35.340 Locus tendai is enough for the
01:15:37.679 government and Parliament to do nothing
01:15:41.760 that will be just wishful thinking and
01:15:44.760 Wishful Thinking is no substitute for
01:15:47.460 careful legal analysis or proper policy
01:15:51.780 if we engage in visual thinking and if
01:15:54.719 section 377a is struck down in the
01:15:57.000 courts that could lead to a whole series
01:15:59.460 of consequences which would be very
01:16:01.920 damaging to our Singaporean Society
01:16:04.739 I'll come back to this
01:16:06.480 but before I do that it is useful to
01:16:08.820 look at what happened in India as an
01:16:11.460 illustration
01:16:13.199 in India there is section 377 was
01:16:16.199 challenged on grounds broadly similar to
01:16:18.840 those used to challenge our 377a in
01:16:22.500 Singapore in 2009
01:16:25.020 the Delhi High Court ruled that section
01:16:28.080 377 was unconstitutional
01:16:31.260 the court then said that its decision
01:16:33.420 would apply only until Parliament
01:16:35.640 repealed section 377 as per the
01:16:39.179 recommendations made by a law Commission
01:16:41.340 in the year 2000.
01:16:43.980 nine years before the decision of the
01:16:45.840 Court
01:16:46.980 after the Judgment however
01:16:49.440 Indian Parliament did not do anything
01:16:51.179 about the law the government also did
01:16:53.520 not appeal the high court judgment
01:16:55.280 instead an appeal was brought by some
01:16:57.719 organizations and individuals
01:17:07.080 on appeal in 2013 the Indian Supreme
01:17:09.480 Court overturned the high court decision
01:17:11.880 saying there was no constitutional
01:17:13.980 infirmity so section 377 was held to be
01:17:17.880 constitutional
01:17:19.620 nonetheless the court emphasized that
01:17:21.780 Parliament was still free to consider
01:17:23.940 the desirability and propriety of
01:17:26.880 deleting section 377 from the Indian
01:17:30.120 Penal Code or amending it to exclude
01:17:33.120 private acts between consenting adults
01:17:35.940 Parliament however did nothing after
01:17:37.860 this decision
01:17:39.179 in 2016 a fresh application was filed in
01:17:42.420 the Indian Supreme Court to again
01:17:44.460 challenge the constitutionality of
01:17:46.320 section 377
01:17:48.840 in 2018 the Indian Supreme Court ruled
01:17:51.659 section 377 to be unconstitutional with
01:17:55.500 regards to consensual acts between
01:17:57.300 adults
01:18:02.040 It reversed its 2013 decision on the
01:18:04.560 grounds that section 377
01:18:06.600 violated the right to life and Liberty
01:18:08.820 which is article 9 of our Constitution
01:18:11.219 that it violated the right to equal
01:18:14.040 protection which is article 12 of our
01:18:16.800 constitution
01:18:19.800 and that it violated the right to
01:18:22.440 freedom of expression which is article
01:18:24.179 14 of our constitution
01:18:26.280 and the court found that section 377
01:18:30.480 did punish homosexuals arbitrarily
01:18:34.739 the court said that a subjective notion
01:18:37.020 of public or societal morality which
01:18:39.960 discriminated against LGBT persons and
01:18:43.020 subjected them to criminal sanctions
01:18:44.940 simply on the basis of an innate
01:18:47.699 characteristic ran counted to the Indian
01:18:50.699 constitution and could not form the
01:18:53.280 basis of legitimate State interest
01:18:56.400 caught hell that parliament's failure to
01:18:58.440 delete section 377 was not in any way a
01:19:02.159 good reason for the court not to strike
01:19:03.960 down section 377.
01:19:06.360 when a provision violated the
01:19:07.980 Constitution the courts must strike it
01:19:10.320 down
01:19:11.280 fast forward to this year 2022 as
01:19:14.520 Minister masagos as mentioned in speech
01:19:17.040 the Indian Supreme Court has expanded
01:19:19.500 the definition of family to include
01:19:21.780 same-sex relationships the Court held
01:19:24.900 that such atypical manifestations of the
01:19:28.320 family unit are equally deserving of
01:19:31.739 protection
01:19:33.239 what is the lesson here when Parliament
01:19:36.000 does not act when it should act then we
01:19:40.260 may leave the courts with no choice
01:19:42.420 if fundamental constitutional rights
01:19:44.520 have been violated and yet Parliament
01:19:47.120 abdicates its duties
01:19:49.980 then the courts may have no choice but
01:19:52.920 to act and what will happen what can
01:19:56.040 happen if the courts strike down section
01:19:58.440 377a
01:20:00.000 then our laws defining marriage
01:20:02.760 as being between a man and a woman and
01:20:05.699 our laws and policies based on that
01:20:08.520 definition could also be at risk
01:20:11.040 sometime in the future
01:20:12.600 for example the heterosexual definition
01:20:15.600 of marriage could be challenged on the
01:20:18.060 basis that is against article 12 of The
01:20:20.760 Constitution
01:20:22.020 it could be argued that equal protection
01:20:24.000 means we cannot discriminate against
01:20:25.860 same-sex couples in the same way that
01:20:28.800 section 377a can be said to discriminate
01:20:32.400 against gay persons it could be asked
01:20:34.980 why should a marriage only be between a
01:20:36.900 man and a woman
01:20:38.040 why can't a marriage between two men or
01:20:40.679 between two women be considered a
01:20:43.020 marriage
01:20:43.920 some places jurisdictions like Taiwan
01:20:46.920 and some countries like the United
01:20:48.360 States
01:20:49.320 have ended up legalizing same-sex
01:20:52.140 marriage through Court challenges as
01:20:54.719 mentioned earlier India's Supreme Court
01:20:56.219 also recently said that family will
01:20:59.699 include same-sex relationships
01:21:03.480 in Singapore so far the courts have
01:21:05.460 recognized that Parliament as the
01:21:06.960 elected branch of government is better
01:21:08.520 suited to resolve such difficult
01:21:10.260 societal issues
01:21:11.940 in Parliament there can be consultation
01:21:14.600 discussion debate considerations going
01:21:18.179 well beyond the law can be taken into
01:21:19.980 account
01:21:21.239 whereas course can only consider the
01:21:23.880 legal issues
01:21:25.860 consensus can be forged in Parliament to
01:21:28.860 bridge Divergent viewpoints
01:21:31.440 open-ended resolutions are possible
01:21:33.620 instead of binary win lose outcomes
01:21:37.140 there are some who have said sins of a
01:21:39.360 courts have recognized what belongs to
01:21:41.760 the political process and what belongs
01:21:44.340 to the judicial process it is unlikely
01:21:46.980 that the courts will ever strike down
01:21:48.540 section 377a in other words we can just
01:21:52.020 take the easy way we don't need to
01:21:53.640 decide we just let things be
01:21:55.620 but such an approach would be
01:21:57.420 irresponsible
01:21:59.219 and wrong
01:22:00.780 members may know a court of appeal has
01:22:03.179 also said that although the 2007
01:22:06.060 compromise was inherently political
01:22:08.360 legal standards do still exist and may
01:22:12.120 be applied to judge the legality or
01:22:15.480 constitutionality of section 377a
01:22:18.719 so we should not assume that the courts
01:22:20.940 will never strike down 377a just because
01:22:24.000 the government chooses to retain it
01:22:27.239 our system has only worked well in all
01:22:31.080 these years because all three branches
01:22:33.840 of the government
01:22:35.280 Parliament all three branches of this
01:22:38.699 State Parliament the executive and the
01:22:41.460 Judiciary
01:22:42.480 work within their respective boundaries
01:22:45.300 and have fulfilled their respective
01:22:47.400 roles
01:22:48.780 but if Parliament does not do its Duty
01:22:51.659 if Parliament does not deal with the law
01:22:53.760 which is likely unconstitutional
01:22:57.780 then you may leave the courts with no
01:23:00.000 choice if Parliament does not do what it
01:23:02.699 has to do
01:23:03.780 then the courts will have to do what
01:23:07.560 they don't want to do
01:23:09.840 so I emphasize
01:23:11.699 Parliament has a duty to deal squarely
01:23:14.280 with laws which are unconstitutional
01:23:18.719 if Parliament abdicates its Duty and
01:23:21.780 does not do what it has to do
01:23:24.120 then the courts may have to do what they
01:23:27.420 don't want to do
01:23:29.640 it would be much easier for us as MPS to
01:23:32.940 leave this to the courts
01:23:35.219 leave the question to the wisdom of The
01:23:37.140 Honorable Court as the Indian government
01:23:38.940 did
01:23:40.320 if we left it to the courts the
01:23:42.179 government would bear no blame it is a
01:23:44.040 path of least resistance
01:23:46.380 if we approached this purely as
01:23:48.840 politicians concerned only with votes
01:23:53.699 and not
01:23:55.440 making anyone unhappy or making as few
01:23:58.739 people unhappy as possible
01:24:00.960 then
01:24:03.840 that
01:24:05.699 root of leaving it to the course would
01:24:07.440 have been easier pretend that these
01:24:09.659 issues do not exist need not have been
01:24:11.699 talked about after the court of appeal
01:24:13.860 decision in tanzan key leave it to the
01:24:15.600 courts
01:24:16.560 but this government will not take that
01:24:19.440 approach
01:24:20.580 as elected representatives of the people
01:24:23.060 we cannot do that
01:24:25.560 if we see a risk
01:24:28.560 that a law may be found unconstitutional
01:24:31.080 it is our duty to act and deal with it
01:24:34.320 in Parliament
01:24:36.420 both because it is our duty to do so and
01:24:39.659 because taking the easy way out would
01:24:42.179 have serious negative consequences for
01:24:45.960 our society it will be very bad for
01:24:48.600 Singapore
01:24:49.679 as I said earlier the court processors
01:24:51.659 are adversarial by Nature
01:24:53.880 their decisions are binary Zero Sum you
01:24:57.659 either win or you lose there is no
01:25:00.239 middle ground no balancing of competing
01:25:02.159 interests the courts cannot consider
01:25:05.340 competing social norms and social
01:25:07.860 consequences of their decisions
01:25:10.140 if they strike down section 377a they
01:25:13.739 will do so without being able to
01:25:15.659 consider the consequential effects of
01:25:18.239 their decision on the definition of
01:25:20.460 marriage for example
01:25:22.020 whereas in Parliament we are now
01:25:24.480 proposing amendments to the Constitution
01:25:26.280 to further protect
01:25:28.520 heterosexual marriage
01:25:31.260 going further if the definition of
01:25:33.120 marriage is changed through a court
01:25:34.679 challenge that can be a cascading effect
01:25:37.980 it could impact questions relating
01:25:39.960 relating to same-sex marriage
01:25:42.480 media content housing policies various
01:25:45.360 other policies how these housing
01:25:47.699 policies can be challenged it could be
01:25:50.219 asked why should we only give housing
01:25:52.980 benefits to heterosexual married couples
01:25:56.699 it could be argued that that is unequal
01:25:58.800 under article 12. media content rules
01:26:01.800 could be challenged why should we impose
01:26:03.780 higher ratings
01:26:05.280 for content on movies and Netflix that
01:26:07.980 depict same-sex family units
01:26:10.380 it could be argued that this curtails
01:26:12.540 some producers freedom of expression and
01:26:14.520 article 9.
01:26:16.020 if we
01:26:17.699 such changes through the courts are not
01:26:20.400 in our interests if you want to act in
01:26:22.800 the best interests of Singapore then we
01:26:26.280 have to move on this given the legal
01:26:28.800 analysis
01:26:30.659 we can look at the United States to see
01:26:32.520 how Court decisions on such issues
01:26:35.100 can seriously affect the fabric of
01:26:37.560 society divide the society unleash
01:26:40.980 partisan views on both sides of the
01:26:43.440 Divine we have that in Singapore
01:26:46.380 our social fabric will Fray
01:26:49.440 if the government and Parliament do not
01:26:52.800 take responsibility and instead stand by
01:26:55.860 and do nothing then litigation could
01:26:58.620 change our societal norms
01:27:01.080 very quickly
01:27:02.460 now I want to emphasize this
01:27:05.040 I have given two reasons for
01:27:07.199 proposing the repeal of section 377a one
01:27:11.219 we should do so because there are no
01:27:14.040 public order issues that are raised from
01:27:16.620 such conduct so it should not remain
01:27:19.020 Criminal
01:27:20.699 but I accept that MPS and Others May
01:27:22.980 disagree with that that even though
01:27:25.440 there are no public our issues they may
01:27:27.300 feel that there are other reasons for
01:27:28.920 keeping the law and I accept that people
01:27:31.199 can and do legitimately have such views
01:27:34.500 and it's reasonable to hold such views
01:27:37.440 but the second reason I've given the
01:27:40.020 legal consequences that's not a matter
01:27:42.000 of conscience it's a policy question
01:27:45.239 it requires each of us to think
01:27:47.340 carefully and apply our minds
01:27:54.719 the second question is a matter of
01:27:56.880 considering the consequences for
01:27:58.800 Singapore
01:28:00.360 given that there's a clear legal risk
01:28:02.520 that section 3778 could be struck down
01:28:05.340 and given that
01:28:07.980 having heard me you know what the
01:28:10.679 consequential legal risks are in fact
01:28:12.840 this has been talked about in public
01:28:15.239 what the consequential legal risks are
01:28:17.400 to the heterosexual family housing
01:28:19.980 education other policies that they could
01:28:22.679 all be at risk knowing all these risks
01:28:26.280 and refusing to take a position
01:28:28.980 or be clear in how we will deal with it
01:28:33.060 is avoiding our responsibilities as MPS
01:28:37.199 basically passing it on onto the courts
01:28:40.199 it is easier politically but it's also
01:28:43.260 worse for Singapore and singaporeans and
01:28:46.440 to put it bluntly that will be an
01:28:49.020 abdication of Duty and it would be
01:28:51.600 cynical
01:28:52.800 if we as MPS did that
01:28:56.340 because we will be putting
01:28:58.620 if we take this as a deliberate decision
01:29:01.280 political capital
01:29:03.900 over doing what is good for singaporeans
01:29:07.620 so Mr Speaker
01:29:09.900 I believe
01:29:11.580 that
01:29:13.020 in this house
01:29:14.760 if we proceed in good faith
01:29:17.880 there are matters of conscience
01:29:20.400 But ultimately there is also the
01:29:22.980 question of what is in Singapore's
01:29:24.840 interest
01:29:26.219 and what is in the interest of
01:29:28.380 singaporeans
01:29:30.239 and the law here
01:29:32.820 and the legal consequences here
01:29:36.540 go beyond matters of conscience
01:29:39.840 this is like a train approaching
01:29:42.840 question is
01:29:45.000 are we prepared to take the appropriate
01:29:47.940 steps
01:29:49.199 to save and save God what is important
01:29:52.320 for our society
01:29:54.540 whether
01:29:56.280 we have the courage
01:29:59.159 of our conviction which should be to do
01:30:02.760 what is good for Singapore
01:30:05.400 so Mr Speaker I say to all members let
01:30:08.400 us do what is right do our duty what is
01:30:10.980 expected of us
01:30:13.080 in Parliament
01:30:14.760 and take a path forward
01:30:17.760 on this difficult issue thank you
01:30:24.360 question is that the bill been already
01:30:25.860 the second time Mr Freedom Singh
01:30:51.900 Mr Speaker
01:30:53.520 beyond the bread and butter matters of
01:30:56.159 economics and material well-being
01:30:58.500 singaporeans must occasionally confront
01:31:00.960 issues that concern our Collective
01:31:03.719 values
01:31:05.280 how we see each other as a Citizen
01:31:07.739 Community
01:31:09.060 and what kind of place
01:31:10.860 we want Singapore to be
01:31:13.440 section 377a of the penal code which I
01:31:16.560 will henceforth refer to as 377a
01:31:20.040 that criminalizes homosexual conduct in
01:31:22.739 private
01:31:23.880 is such an issue
01:31:26.100 for some singaporeans it is a very
01:31:28.980 difficult subject
01:31:31.320 for others especially younger
01:31:33.480 singaporeans
01:31:34.800 they Wonder
01:31:36.420 why it has to be a difficult subject
01:31:39.120 and why people of a different sexual
01:31:41.159 orientation
01:31:42.540 can be treated as equal singaporeans
01:31:48.600 in recent years the issue has caused
01:31:51.120 growing tensions between groups who
01:31:53.340 identify themselves for
01:31:55.440 and against the repeal of section 3778
01:32:00.120 singaporeans have formed organizations
01:32:03.060 and groups on the issue
01:32:04.980 at a personal level the conversations
01:32:07.199 can be uncomfortable
01:32:09.360 And discussing the subject without
01:32:10.920 measure and consideration
01:32:13.139 can quickly pull people apart
01:32:16.800 speaking in the individual capacities
01:32:19.139 the Workers Party MPS have different
01:32:21.179 views on a repeal of 377a
01:32:25.139 in normal circumstances I would not lift
01:32:27.540 the whip for parliamentary debates given
01:32:30.120 the party political structure that
01:32:31.800 overlays elected MPS in this house
01:32:35.580 however 377a is unique in that it is
01:32:39.300 conceived through a religious lens by
01:32:41.280 many
01:32:42.120 in Singapore
01:32:44.040 in addition to being a matter of
01:32:45.600 conscience for no less significant
01:32:47.639 number
01:32:49.560 the people's action party has announced
01:32:51.480 that it is not lifting the whip for this
01:32:53.219 debate
01:32:54.719 given the very public opinion on the
01:32:57.000 impending repeal of 377a
01:32:59.820 there is a risk that the Democratic
01:33:02.219 value of parliament could be diluted if
01:33:05.280 the views of singaporeans on this
01:33:07.020 subject are not adequately ventilated in
01:33:10.080 the house
01:33:12.179 not lifting the whip would deny Workers
01:33:15.120 Party MPS not in favor of a repeal of
01:33:17.820 377a the opportunity to vote freely
01:33:21.540 and in doing so to also represent
01:33:24.120 singaporeans who see this issue as a
01:33:26.639 matter of deep religious belief and
01:33:29.100 conscience
01:33:30.960 so I have decided to lift the whip for
01:33:32.880 the workers party in peace
01:33:34.980 in doing so I have also asked all who
01:33:38.040 will speak
01:33:39.420 to carefully reflect on the position
01:33:41.639 they take
01:33:43.199 and to Envision a set of principles or
01:33:45.900 perspectives from which society as a
01:33:48.659 whole
01:33:49.980 with its different views
01:33:52.199 can move forward
01:33:53.940 that is the challenge
01:33:56.219 we know Society is divided on 377a
01:33:59.639 how can we mitigate this and contribute
01:34:02.340 to lowering temperatures
01:34:04.320 and ensuring Singapore is a home for
01:34:08.340 everyone
01:34:09.840 for the record Mr Speaker
01:34:12.300 both members of parliament Faisal manab
01:34:14.460 and Louis straw are not present for this
01:34:16.139 debate as they are covid-19 positive
01:34:19.380 Mr Faisal disagrees with the repeal of
01:34:21.659 377a as a matter of religion and
01:34:23.820 conscience while Mr Chua agrees to the
01:34:26.639 repeal
01:34:27.780 the other Workers Party MPS will state
01:34:29.760 their positions on the matter
01:34:31.440 in the course of their speeches
01:34:34.440 Mr Speaker since 2007 the government has
01:34:38.280 settled on what has what was called an
01:34:40.800 uneasy compromise
01:34:42.480 that 377a would be kept on the books
01:34:46.080 but not enforced
01:34:48.300 in 2019 in my first term as Secretary
01:34:51.179 General of the workers party I stated
01:34:53.400 the workers party's position on 377a in
01:34:57.060 a speech to the nus or National
01:34:58.679 University of Singapore political
01:35:00.300 Association
01:35:02.159 the party position I advanced was
01:35:04.020 similar to that of Singapore as a whole
01:35:06.719 it was varied and diverse
01:35:09.480 with no consensus as to whether 377a
01:35:13.020 should be repealed
01:35:16.500 the depth of the impasse in Singapore
01:35:18.840 Society at that time was stuck and
01:35:21.860 encapsulated somewhat in a panel
01:35:24.120 discussion between cinema cinema
01:35:27.260 and Professor Tommy cool on The
01:35:30.540 Institute of policy studies 30th
01:35:32.639 anniversary in late 2018.
01:35:35.340 Professor Koh said and I quote
01:35:38.280 a mutual friend of ours was recently
01:35:40.679 invited by one of our religious
01:35:42.960 organizations to speak at a conference
01:35:46.320 on a secular topic
01:35:48.780 he accepted
01:35:50.580 prepared the paper
01:35:52.560 and then
01:35:53.760 he was disinvited
01:35:56.460 and why was he disinvited
01:35:59.460 because he signed a petition to repeal
01:36:02.719 377a unquote
01:36:06.480 such has been the device the
01:36:08.460 divisiveness over 377a
01:36:11.880 in my 2019 speech I said that the LGBT
01:36:15.300 community should lgbtq plus Community
01:36:18.860 should not be exploited for political
01:36:21.420 points
01:36:22.920 at that time I believe there was more to
01:36:25.380 consider than deciding which was the
01:36:27.480 right side in this matter
01:36:28.980 particularly in a society which
01:36:30.780 generally astuces from hosting open and
01:36:33.120 Frank conversations on difficult matters
01:36:35.340 in the public Realm
01:36:37.739 against this political culture and
01:36:39.719 backdrop the Workers Party neither took
01:36:41.820 up the cause of lgbtq plus rights no
01:36:44.580 stood against it
01:36:46.500 I still believe that had the Workers
01:36:48.659 Party openly supported a repeal of 377a
01:36:53.760 it would not have been good for
01:36:55.020 Singapore politics
01:36:57.000 more crucially
01:36:58.560 it would have not served the interests
01:37:00.960 of the lgbtq plus community
01:37:04.199 on issues of great social Division and
01:37:07.080 contending values we do not need
01:37:10.020 politicians to be seen as siding with
01:37:12.120 particular groups
01:37:15.179 from my vantage point as the leader of
01:37:17.159 the opposition my personal belief is
01:37:19.560 that the repeal of 377a
01:37:22.080 does not in any way signal the state's
01:37:24.480 hostility towards the family unit or
01:37:26.880 religious freedom
01:37:28.620 rest assured the family remains and I
01:37:31.320 dare say will always be at the core of
01:37:33.300 our social norms
01:37:35.639 I would also like to reiterate that
01:37:37.500 defending the Singaporean family also
01:37:39.600 means doing more to protect its
01:37:41.159 different forms including families with
01:37:43.860 single we do and divorced mothers and
01:37:47.040 fathers
01:37:48.120 we must do more to help caregivers who
01:37:50.219 perform the labor of caring for Aged
01:37:52.199 parents and those with special needs
01:37:55.260 what the repeal of three seven says 377a
01:37:58.500 certainly does not signal is Singapore
01:38:00.960 becoming a more liberal or permissive
01:38:03.300 Society
01:38:04.620 what it does
01:38:06.000 is make room in our shared public space
01:38:09.239 for members of our common Singaporean
01:38:11.400 family to not be discriminated against
01:38:14.280 due to their sexual orientation
01:38:18.179 religious singaporeans are free to
01:38:20.280 maintain their beliefs about
01:38:21.300 homosexuality but this should not
01:38:23.699 interfere with what is legal in our
01:38:26.280 public sphere
01:38:27.960 likewise supporters of repeal have no
01:38:30.480 business interfering with the private
01:38:32.159 beliefs of religious singaporeans
01:38:35.940 in any secular society sin and crime
01:38:40.199 are separate categories
01:38:42.000 they may sometimes align
01:38:44.280 for example we have laws prohibiting
01:38:46.560 crimes such as murder
01:38:48.780 that are also considered wrong in many
01:38:51.300 belief systems
01:38:52.860 but we also do not Outlaw many
01:38:54.540 activities considered sinful in some
01:38:56.580 religious communities
01:38:58.139 consuming alcohol and pork are legal but
01:39:01.199 not permissible to Muslims
01:39:03.420 there are also no laws against eating
01:39:05.340 meat though this is not an option for
01:39:07.380 genes and some Hindus and Buddhists
01:39:10.080 one may argue that 377a is a much more
01:39:14.340 complex than not regulating sexual
01:39:17.159 practices
01:39:18.900 has greater social consequences
01:39:23.040 but let us remember that when section
01:39:24.840 when 377 section 377a of the penal code
01:39:28.320 was amended in 2007. it decriminalized
01:39:31.980 other sex acts that some still find
01:39:34.920 unorthodox
01:39:36.600 in singling out homosexuality between
01:39:39.000 men in particular
01:39:40.679 the decision to keep 377a
01:39:44.100 appears to the lgbtq plus community and
01:39:47.159 not and not a small number of
01:39:49.380 singaporeans to be unjust
01:39:51.900 and unequal
01:39:54.000 an important reality is that the
01:39:56.040 political compromise in place since 2007
01:39:58.699 undermined the sense of belonging of
01:40:00.900 Singapore's lgbtq plus community
01:40:04.139 though an enforced
01:40:06.060 one should not underestimate its
01:40:08.100 symbolic message that they are Outsiders
01:40:12.060 additionally this so-called compromise
01:40:14.699 is not binding on future governments who
01:40:17.340 could choose to enforce the law
01:40:20.159 yet repealing 377a will no doubt cause
01:40:23.760 anxiety
01:40:25.020 if not Outreach amongst singaporeans who
01:40:27.480 believe that our laws must also reflect
01:40:29.699 cultural or religious attitudes towards
01:40:31.739 homosexuality
01:40:33.420 there are singaporeans who see this as
01:40:35.400 an erosion of the family as a basic unit
01:40:37.620 of Singapore Society
01:40:39.719 the reality of our political culture
01:40:42.060 which leans towards conservatism on
01:40:44.340 social issues is that such concerns
01:40:46.860 cannot be summarily ignored
01:40:49.380 or dismissed
01:40:51.960 in the main the court of appealed
01:40:54.300 judgment in tansenki versus AG
01:40:57.300 appears to have precipitated the
01:40:59.280 government's decision to repeal 377a
01:41:03.300 but the Stark reality before this house
01:41:06.000 and singaporeans today
01:41:08.760 is that there were never any good
01:41:11.100 options before the government that could
01:41:13.440 please everybody with regard to managing
01:41:15.719 the tensions
01:41:17.280 of 377e
01:41:19.920 keeping to the status quo indefinitely
01:41:22.080 would only shine an Ever brighter
01:41:24.239 Spotlight on the issue particularly as
01:41:26.880 social mores globally regionally and
01:41:30.659 locally continue a steady shift towards
01:41:34.260 greater acceptance and accommodation of
01:41:36.900 lgbtq plus individuals
01:41:39.840 like many singaporeans I could
01:41:41.940 understand why the uneasy compromise
01:41:43.980 settled by the prime minister in 2007
01:41:46.380 was deemed to be a midpoint that would
01:41:49.320 keep any excessive social cleavage in
01:41:51.659 check
01:41:53.159 likewise I see the decision to protect
01:41:55.320 marriage from constitutional challenges
01:41:57.360 and institution between men and women
01:41:59.100 only
01:42:00.239 through a very narrow lens it represents
01:42:03.060 a balancing exercise to ensure that
01:42:05.040 Society it also represents a balancing
01:42:07.020 exercise to ensure that Society doesn't
01:42:09.300 Fray Over the decision to repeal 3770.
01:42:13.860 I hope singaporeans who are against the
01:42:16.139 repeal of 377a approach this issue
01:42:19.980 in spite of their personal beliefs and
01:42:22.440 religious convictions which I and my
01:42:24.719 colleagues respect and I suggest
01:42:26.520 everyone in this house respects
01:42:29.100 through this lens of compromise and
01:42:32.159 accommodation
01:42:34.020 in repealing 377a religious singaporeans
01:42:37.500 are not asked to endorse homosexuality
01:42:40.980 but instead honor the equality of all
01:42:43.800 singaporeans in the eyes of the law
01:42:46.260 that no consenting adults should be
01:42:48.420 regarded as criminals because of what
01:42:50.520 they do in private
01:42:53.159 equality and justice both stars in our
01:42:56.639 flag
01:42:57.960 are plenty and Bountiful
01:43:01.199 unlike finite resources we do not have
01:43:04.020 less of either
01:43:05.699 by extending it to our fellow citizens
01:43:09.780 we all gain from a more just and equal
01:43:12.600 Society
01:43:15.659 we can also look to some of the Timeless
01:43:18.000 principles shared amongst all great
01:43:20.219 faiths
01:43:21.420 the Blessed irony here
01:43:24.179 is that religion plays a huge part in
01:43:26.699 inspiring our best qualities as human
01:43:28.739 beings
01:43:29.880 to be generous
01:43:31.560 to love our neighbor
01:43:33.719 to be merciful
01:43:36.060 these qualities do not weaken but
01:43:38.639 strengthen our faith
01:43:40.500 wherever you stand on this decision
01:43:43.080 I hope singaporeans approach our lgbtq
01:43:46.080 plus community
01:43:47.820 who are a small minority of the
01:43:49.980 population
01:43:51.300 like they are anywhere in the world
01:43:54.540 with these qualities in mind
01:43:57.300 more than ever with the impending repeal
01:43:59.639 of 377a singaporeans on all sides must
01:44:03.300 come together in good faith and mutual
01:44:05.639 trust to not let this issue further tear
01:44:08.639 our social fabric
01:44:10.679 I am certain the decision of this house
01:44:14.219 is not a Panacea that repairs the
01:44:16.560 tension between camps
01:44:19.920 we should anticipate that new battle
01:44:21.780 lines will be drawn
01:44:23.699 for the lgbtq plus community
01:44:26.520 the March towards greater equality has
01:44:28.920 not ended
01:44:30.600 some conservatives are likely to
01:44:32.699 mobilize to try and stop any further
01:44:35.460 expansion of lgbtq plus rights
01:44:40.920 in view of the socially divisive nature
01:44:43.320 of 377a I would suggest three points
01:44:46.619 that could help in keeping things from
01:44:49.560 boiling over
01:44:51.119 I hope singaporeans can consider these
01:44:53.219 as guideposts
01:44:54.780 should they deem them useful
01:44:58.440 first any conversation must recognize
01:45:01.800 that there is a distinction between
01:45:03.900 public and private perspectives
01:45:06.239 just because one group has a position on
01:45:09.179 an issue does not mean it can impose
01:45:11.340 that position as a public expectation on
01:45:14.400 everyone else
01:45:16.080 why
01:45:17.460 because in Singapore
01:45:19.260 there must be a place for everyone
01:45:21.900 the public space is for all to share and
01:45:24.840 where we encourage and Live and Let Live
01:45:26.580 give and take attitude towards our
01:45:28.500 fellow singaporeans
01:45:30.360 the public space is where we create
01:45:32.400 conditions for all singaporeans to
01:45:34.380 succeed
01:45:35.400 and certainly not to feel marginalized
01:45:38.760 the public space is where we are
01:45:40.560 tolerant of singaporeans who are
01:45:42.119 different insofar as the law allows
01:45:45.840 second
01:45:47.580 the fact that we are a secular society
01:45:49.860 does not stop religious singaporeans
01:45:52.139 from holding views that are reflective
01:45:54.780 of their religious norms and values
01:45:57.840 it is fully understandable that the
01:46:00.119 faithful wish to propagate their
01:46:01.679 religious convictions
01:46:03.540 there is no basis for us to feel
01:46:05.940 canceled
01:46:06.960 provided our views are not set as an
01:46:09.659 expectation for all Society
01:46:12.840 there must be a secular approach to
01:46:15.179 politics and governance even as we
01:46:17.639 celebrate and protect the freedom of
01:46:19.380 religion in Singapore
01:46:21.480 the Workers Party cannot conceive of any
01:46:23.880 other way for different groups and
01:46:25.440 religious communities to live
01:46:26.699 harmoniously with each other in
01:46:28.380 Singapore
01:46:30.420 finally and perhaps most pertinently as
01:46:33.840 we are free to share our views and
01:46:36.179 propagate our beliefs
01:46:37.920 let us be thoughtful and put ourselves
01:46:40.440 in the other person's shoes as we
01:46:43.500 welcome conversation
01:46:45.179 and even vigorous debate
01:46:47.639 but as with most difficult conversations
01:46:49.800 in search of a landing point
01:46:52.080 it will be crucial to adopt a gentler
01:46:54.900 tone
01:46:56.340 an enlightened perspective that extends
01:46:58.500 and considers the impact on broader
01:47:00.420 community and Society
01:47:02.580 and most fundamentally a spirit of
01:47:05.159 empathy Mr Speaker I support both the
01:47:08.280 penal code and Constitutional Amendment
01:47:09.960 bills thank you
01:47:13.020 foreign
01:47:36.179 one might be tempted to say that this
01:47:38.580 issue is one of the most polarizing and
01:47:41.100 contentious socio-political issues that
01:47:43.980 this house ever dealt with
01:47:46.080 the heavy correspondence that I received
01:47:48.119 and numerous meetings that I had with my
01:47:50.520 constituents on this matter reflects
01:47:52.080 that I'm sure I'm not alone in this
01:47:55.619 let's be clear though should this
01:47:57.900 beetles be passed it does not mean that
01:48:00.179 the underlying issues will simply go
01:48:02.400 away it will not
01:48:04.260 at the same time
01:48:05.880 the fact that we are considering these
01:48:08.340 bills does signify a potential for this
01:48:11.340 house to express its Collective will and
01:48:14.100 I heard the honorable leader opposition
01:48:15.840 say Collective values as well across
01:48:18.780 party lights and decides on on the basis
01:48:22.020 of what is the greater good of our
01:48:24.600 country
01:48:25.500 this is what representative politics
01:48:28.800 means
01:48:29.880 MP is deciding on matters based on
01:48:32.340 national interests and public good not
01:48:34.080 their personal interests
01:48:36.000 the well-known politician and
01:48:39.659 philosopher Sir Edmund Burke said that
01:48:43.080 Parliament is not a Congress of
01:48:45.600 ambassadors where members of parliament
01:48:49.139 we have to decide based on national
01:48:50.820 interests and not just based on the
01:48:53.699 opinions of their constituents this is
01:48:56.940 where
01:48:57.780 our
01:48:59.699 involvement here becomes all the more
01:49:01.739 important because we cannot decide just
01:49:04.320 on the basis of our personal views we
01:49:07.739 have to decide on the basis of what is
01:49:10.199 the national interest how best can we
01:49:12.480 take Singapore forward and ensure that
01:49:15.480 the future of singaporeans will always
01:49:17.219 remain bright that's the issue
01:49:20.520 so what is my view with respect to this
01:49:22.619 issue
01:49:24.600 I understand from the leader of
01:49:27.060 opposition that he's decided to lift the
01:49:29.280 opposite the whip
01:49:31.380 I just want to clarify that while the
01:49:33.600 whip is not lifted for the people's
01:49:35.159 Action Party it does not prevent any MP
01:49:38.219 for my party to speak his views and I
01:49:40.800 will shortly speak My Views too
01:49:42.780 it the whip is basically a system to
01:49:45.480 deal with voting and that's separate and
01:49:47.880 distinct from clearly and honestly
01:49:50.520 expressing our views
01:49:53.040 on my view I can be relatively brief
01:49:56.400 this is because I had already
01:49:59.219 articulated my views on this matter in
01:50:02.520 2018 when I was interviewed by CNA
01:50:06.000 then I stated my support for the repeal
01:50:08.580 of section 377a I said that anyone
01:50:12.179 regardless of his sexual orientation is
01:50:15.300 deserving of equal treatment dignity and
01:50:18.179 respect
01:50:19.080 no one should be treated as social
01:50:20.880 outcasts
01:50:22.440 I also advocated a holistic review of
01:50:24.780 the matter before any legislative
01:50:26.639 decisions made to address the legis
01:50:29.100 legitimate concerns that the repeal of
01:50:32.100 section 377a may have an impact on
01:50:34.980 important institutions such as marriage
01:50:37.739 and family
01:50:39.360 I therefore have no hesitation in
01:50:41.340 supporting the carefully calibrated
01:50:43.920 Provisions in these bills today
01:50:46.619 repealing section 377a is the right
01:50:48.960 thing to do homosexual meals in
01:50:51.300 consenting relationships will no longer
01:50:53.580 be viewed as criminals and we would have
01:50:55.980 taken a decisive step in removing the
01:50:59.639 stigma that they previously faced
01:51:02.100 this is the main principle underlying
01:51:04.320 the review
01:51:05.820 I'm indebted to The Honorable Minister
01:51:07.699 for painstakingly reviewing the
01:51:11.639 provision based on materials stretching
01:51:15.300 back to the 16th century listening to
01:51:17.400 him it seems to me that the legislative
01:51:20.100 objective behind the equivalent of
01:51:21.960 section 377a is also rather obscure
01:51:25.139 at the same time the amendments to the
01:51:28.679 Constitution in this house makes it
01:51:30.600 clear that the repeal of section 377a
01:51:33.420 will not affect the important
01:51:35.820 institution of marriage as between a man
01:51:38.219 and a woman and the government policies
01:51:40.800 promoting this traditional families this
01:51:43.320 is in a court with the views of a
01:51:45.360 significant majority of singaporeans
01:51:47.639 there are important lessons that can be
01:51:49.500 drawn from the government's approach in
01:51:51.719 this house to deal with this issue I
01:51:54.060 wish to highlight three first it is
01:51:56.940 about ensuring that our nation for now
01:51:59.400 and I hope for at least the next 20
01:52:01.320 years will continue to be United and
01:52:04.199 stable and not failed to hold because of
01:52:06.960 this divisive issue so much of what we
01:52:10.139 do as a country depends on our unity and
01:52:13.679 stability
01:52:14.880 we cannot afford to lose that
01:52:16.800 we do this by making the political
01:52:18.960 accommodation that this builds
01:52:20.820 collectively represent something that
01:52:22.679 The Honorable prime minister spoke about
01:52:24.060 at some length during his National Day
01:52:26.100 rally 2022
01:52:27.960 what we need to guard against is a
01:52:30.239 specter of identity politics with an
01:52:32.400 emphasis on an All or Nothing mindset if
01:52:35.340 that happens in Singapore I fear that it
01:52:37.739 may be the beginning of the end of
01:52:39.420 Singapore's cohesive social compact
01:52:42.540 second it's about acknowledging that our
01:52:45.540 laws reflect the changing realities of
01:52:47.699 our times this includes respecting the
01:52:50.280 voices of all sections of society
01:52:52.460 including those of our youths they are
01:52:55.920 voices on their vision and aspirations
01:52:58.380 for Singapore our youths shape the
01:53:01.080 future of our country
01:53:02.639 based on the Today youth survey 2022
01:53:05.460 published in today on 15 November 2022
01:53:09.780 about two-thirds of our young adults
01:53:13.260 agreed that the repeal of a law
01:53:15.980 criminalizing gay sex represents a step
01:53:18.960 towards a more inclusive Society
01:53:22.440 these are millennials and gen zedders
01:53:25.860 this is a sizable majority
01:53:28.139 we need to forge an intergenerational
01:53:30.540 understanding to keep us together as a
01:53:33.360 society
01:53:34.380 our founding prime minister the late Mr
01:53:36.360 Lee Kuan Yew bitterly put this across in
01:53:38.520 a speech she delivered way back in 1966
01:53:40.920 about the importance of working with our
01:53:43.260 youths to create an enduring future in
01:53:45.960 the context of multi-racial Harmony he
01:53:48.300 said and I quote the young are so
01:53:50.219 important
01:53:51.179 we are old our values our attitudes are
01:53:54.480 fixed but the minds of the young are
01:53:57.179 flexible they come out of with Innocent
01:53:59.880 Minds
01:54:01.080 and we must give them the values of
01:54:03.719 Tolerance understanding togetherness and
01:54:06.239 a society which gives everybody a
01:54:08.520 meaningful life and in that way we will
01:54:11.400 secure an enduring future for ourselves
01:54:13.440 unquote here we have an opportunity
01:54:17.280 as currently based on the same today
01:54:19.440 youth survey three or five youths
01:54:22.080 support the importance of upholding the
01:54:24.840 definition of marriage as between one
01:54:27.060 man and a woman this was reportedly
01:54:30.360 attributed to our youths internalizing
01:54:32.639 the traditional definition of marriage
01:54:34.980 as a norm
01:54:37.020 third
01:54:38.159 it is about upholding the legitimacy of
01:54:40.619 our democratic system of government that
01:54:42.540 we have in Singapore both The Honorable
01:54:44.340 Minister spoke about this
01:54:46.619 in our West ministers personal
01:54:48.480 government our Judiciary is an
01:54:51.060 independent organ of state that is
01:54:53.159 vested with judicial power to decide on
01:54:55.320 legal issues without interference from
01:54:58.020 this house or the executive
01:55:00.480 being an unelected body it is not
01:55:02.699 directly accountable to our people we
01:55:05.100 have seen examples in other countries
01:55:07.380 where judges accused of playing politics
01:55:09.840 when deciding on legal issues there are
01:55:12.420 major social political ramifications
01:55:15.420 in the U.S we saw The Swinging of the
01:55:18.360 pendulum from one end to the other just
01:55:21.000 about five months ago when the federal
01:55:23.460 right to of choice to abort established
01:55:26.340 in a 1973 case was overturned by a
01:55:29.760 majority in the U.S Supreme Court in
01:55:32.040 favor of restoring the state's power to
01:55:34.980 Outlaw abortion
01:55:36.780 this is Costa Ferrari based on a
01:55:39.540 September 2022 Pew Research Center
01:55:41.639 survey Americans ratings of the Supreme
01:55:44.760 Court are now as negative
01:55:47.460 s and more politically polarized then
01:55:50.159 than any point in time during the three
01:55:53.040 decades of polling among on the nation's
01:55:55.739 highest court
01:55:57.300 such sentiments undermine the confidence
01:55:59.760 in and the legitimacy of the Judiciary
01:56:03.000 this in turn can affect the rule of law
01:56:05.219 in Singapore
01:56:07.380 we must avoid it and the way to do it is
01:56:10.320 to ensure that the policy issues that
01:56:12.179 have socio-political ramifications are
01:56:14.460 dealt with firmly in this house
01:56:16.800 we in this house have much have a much
01:56:19.320 better ability to deal with such Tony
01:56:21.420 issues as compared to the courts as
01:56:23.460 elected representatives we have a much
01:56:25.739 better pulse on what our people think
01:56:27.540 and what is needed to ensure our
01:56:29.760 nation's cohesiveness we also have a
01:56:32.159 unique ability to accommodate diversion
01:56:33.960 views and reach a consensus that allows
01:56:36.900 our society to march on and make
01:56:39.540 progress
01:56:40.860 this is not a fanciful argument
01:56:43.080 in 2018 the Singapore High Court decided
01:56:46.440 to allow a Singaporean gay man to adopt
01:56:49.800 a son he fathered through a surrogate
01:56:51.900 mother by paying her
01:56:54.300 U.S 200 000 because
01:56:57.780 amongst others the Singapore government
01:57:00.060 had not promulgated then a policy
01:57:03.719 against surrogacy
01:57:05.580 in discussing this case in this house in
01:57:07.860 January 2019 The Honorable Minister Mr
01:57:10.320 Desmond Lee in a carefully worded
01:57:12.420 statement acknowledged the decision has
01:57:15.599 and I quote evoked a diverse range of
01:57:18.900 emotions and reactions among
01:57:21.239 singaporeans and raised questions about
01:57:23.400 its implications unquote so it is best
01:57:26.699 that we in this house continue to take
01:57:29.280 the lead to set policies that have
01:57:31.440 socio-political ramifications to
01:57:33.360 preserve the legitimacy of our system of
01:57:35.820 government particularly our judiciary
01:57:38.580 I have a query in relation to the
01:57:40.920 proposed article 156 subsection 3 and 4
01:57:44.040 of The Constitution part four of the
01:57:46.679 Constitution lists the fundamental
01:57:48.000 Liberties these are described in the
01:57:50.460 1957 report of Federation of Malaya
01:57:52.920 constitutional commission from which our
01:57:55.260 Singapore Constitution was modeled on as
01:57:58.080 and I quote fundamental individual
01:58:00.659 rights which are generally regarded as
01:58:03.780 essential conditions for free and
01:58:06.060 Democratic way of life unquote
01:58:08.400 there are eight rights enumerated in
01:58:11.159 part four they include safeguards
01:58:13.020 against Liberty of a person slavery
01:58:15.060 forced labor protection against
01:58:17.280 retrospective criminal laws equal
01:58:19.560 protection of all persons before the law
01:58:21.679 prohibition of banishment and freedom of
01:58:24.780 movement freedom of speech religion and
01:58:27.480 education
01:58:28.619 the basic idea in this constitution is
01:58:31.199 to protect individuals rights by
01:58:33.599 investing in the courts the power to
01:58:35.760 strike down legislation passed by this
01:58:38.280 house or government action should they
01:58:41.159 offend the fundamental Liberties stated
01:58:43.320 in this constitution
01:58:45.060 it is proposed
01:58:47.099 that the entire part 4 be excluded from
01:58:49.440 application in relation to both a law
01:58:51.840 that defines marriage as a union between
01:58:53.880 men and women and an exercise of
01:58:56.940 executive Authority based on such a
01:58:59.099 definition of marriage
01:59:00.480 in contrast when it comes to laws
01:59:03.179 against subversion and emergency Powers
01:59:05.159 article 149 subsection 1 of the
01:59:07.920 Constitution specifically identifies
01:59:10.500 five Provisions that are to be excluded
01:59:13.260 from part four
01:59:14.520 I hope we see the difference in approach
01:59:16.260 here on matters of National Security we
01:59:19.440 are careful enough to pick out specific
01:59:21.239 exclusions because there are at least
01:59:23.699 three individual rights that are so
01:59:25.619 important so as to be able to stand up
01:59:27.780 against issues pertaining to National
01:59:29.460 Security
01:59:30.540 why then is there a need to adopt a
01:59:34.199 blunderbuss approach in preserving
01:59:36.239 legislation or government action dealing
01:59:38.580 with a definition of marriage as between
01:59:40.679 a man and a woman
01:59:42.659 would it not be possible for the
01:59:44.699 government to identify specific
01:59:46.800 Provisions this is what has been done
01:59:49.380 for article 149 and it's the honorable
01:59:51.480 Minister said article 39a which deals
01:59:55.080 with grcs
01:59:58.139 personally I prefer such an approach I
02:00:01.380 heard the honorable Minister as saying
02:00:03.179 that the reason why we want to have such
02:00:05.699 a shield is because we may not know of
02:00:07.800 an argument that can be raised in the
02:00:09.239 future
02:00:10.080 but we are dealing with fundamental
02:00:11.820 Liberties and one of the reasons for
02:00:14.460 having fundamental Liberties is to curb
02:00:17.340 excess of power or you or have a
02:00:20.639 situation whereby there will be an
02:00:21.840 irrational use of power
02:00:23.880 so as a matter of principle we should be
02:00:26.520 careful in providing for derogations to
02:00:28.500 fundamental Liberties of an individual
02:00:30.239 as you would ordinarily be inimicable
02:00:32.940 inimical to the concept of democracy and
02:00:36.060 rule of law
02:00:37.320 Also may I ask whether it is intended
02:00:40.080 that the Court's powers of judicial
02:00:42.360 review of government action on the
02:00:44.400 traditional grounds of illegality
02:00:46.280 irrationality and procedural in
02:00:49.260 proprietary be understood as I heard the
02:00:51.179 honorable Minister he mentioned that
02:00:53.099 that is not the intent but then maybe to
02:00:56.580 articulate my point let me give an
02:00:58.560 illustration say for example a
02:01:01.080 government in the future decides to
02:01:03.360 banish a citizen now that's a
02:01:06.060 fundamental Liberty under article 13. on
02:01:09.060 the basis that he doesn't subscribe to a
02:01:11.940 marriage between a man and a woman or he
02:01:14.940 enters into a marriage which Falls
02:01:18.420 outside the definition in the woman's
02:01:21.119 Charter how can we then protect such a
02:01:25.260 person from being banished
02:01:27.599 can can the Court's exercise is judicial
02:01:30.920 powers to provide a solution for such a
02:01:35.880 person and I would welcome The Honorable
02:01:37.440 Minister's views on this matter
02:01:39.840 so my point is a simple one that we
02:01:43.320 should put sufficient weight on this but
02:01:45.599 not be
02:01:47.099 too heavy-handed
02:01:48.840 as to allow it to Trump all fundamental
02:01:51.179 rights as even on matters of National
02:01:53.460 Security we have been careful to take
02:01:55.199 such a not to take such a sweeping
02:01:57.119 approach
02:01:59.219 so the repeal is the correct thing to do
02:02:01.679 it reflects Singapore's Collective will
02:02:04.500 towards equality as well as the values
02:02:07.380 and realities of our times we've also at
02:02:10.739 the same time captured the white
02:02:12.540 agreement that marriage is a union
02:02:14.639 between a man and a woman it is an
02:02:18.420 elegant accommodation and a uniquely
02:02:20.760 Singapore way using the honorable
02:02:22.739 Minister massager's words of expressing
02:02:24.780 the will of our people through this
02:02:27.780 house
02:02:31.320 professor huniente
02:02:38.760 my apologies Mr Willem
02:02:55.920 Mr Speaker
02:02:57.900 at the outset I wish to state that I am
02:03:00.659 in support of the penal code Amendment
02:03:02.400 bill
02:03:03.300 this is due to the likely
02:03:04.880 unconstitutionality of section 377a for
02:03:08.460 violating article 12 especially in the
02:03:10.920 light of recent legal developments
02:03:13.380 I wish now to focus on the Constitution
02:03:15.540 Amendment bill before the house
02:03:18.300 third the bill proposes to add a new
02:03:20.520 article 156 to the Constitution
02:03:23.280 I believe it is important to study the
02:03:25.860 various parts of article 156 in detail
02:03:29.699 the first half of article 156 namely
02:03:33.000 sub-articles 1 and 2 state that laws and
02:03:36.719 policies concerning the promotion of the
02:03:38.699 institution of marriage lie within the
02:03:40.980 province of Parliament and the
02:03:42.300 government
02:03:43.320 the second half of article 156 namely
02:03:46.440 subarticles 3 and 4 declare that laws
02:03:49.800 and policies based on the definition of
02:03:51.900 marriage as between a man and a woman
02:03:53.699 cannot be invalidated on the grounds
02:03:56.639 that they violate part 4 of The
02:03:58.800 Constitution on fundamental liberties
02:04:01.199 it is further stated in these two
02:04:03.300 sub-articles that the apparent
02:04:05.340 prohibition of a constitutional
02:04:07.020 challenge will apply to laws and
02:04:09.300 policies that are enforce whether before
02:04:12.560 on or after the commencement of this
02:04:15.480 bill that is for all past current and
02:04:19.139 future laws and policies
02:04:21.719 so from what I understand the amendments
02:04:24.239 to the Constitution are an attempt at a
02:04:27.179 quid pro quo for the repeal of section
02:04:29.780 377a of the penal code
02:04:32.340 the repeal of section 377a is concerning
02:04:35.400 to many singaporeans who are not
02:04:37.380 supportive of the repeal and who fear
02:04:39.780 that the removal of the offense would
02:04:42.119 mainstream gay lifestyles in further
02:04:44.400 spheres of life
02:04:46.440 I see article 156 as the government's
02:04:49.020 way of signaling that the definition of
02:04:51.119 Merit in Singapore would not be changed
02:04:53.400 in the near future
02:04:54.840 however as pointed out by the law
02:04:56.880 minister in August this does not amount
02:04:59.460 to an entrenchment of the definition of
02:05:01.560 marriage as between a man and a woman he
02:05:04.440 and Mr masagos also made clear earlier
02:05:06.540 that it was open to Parliament to change
02:05:08.580 the definition of marriage by amending
02:05:10.679 the law by a simple majority in
02:05:12.360 Parliament
02:05:13.679 it is therefore appropriate to consider
02:05:15.480 what the actual effect of article 156 is
02:05:18.540 I intend to look at each of the four
02:05:21.060 sub-articles in turn
02:05:23.639 first article 1561
02:05:26.340 it is stated that Parliament may pass
02:05:28.560 laws which Define regulate Safeguard
02:05:31.739 support Foster and promote the
02:05:33.780 institution of marriage
02:05:35.340 on the one hand that sounds like a clear
02:05:37.800 statement of what Parliament can do
02:05:40.260 however we do respect I'm not sure what
02:05:42.960 this sub-article actually achieves apart
02:05:45.480 from staking the obvious
02:05:47.400 it is indisputable that under article 38
02:05:50.280 of the Constitution legislative power
02:05:52.679 has already been vested in the
02:05:54.420 legislature consisting of the president
02:05:56.520 and Parliament Parliament can pass laws
02:05:59.699 on any subject in what way then is
02:06:02.400 article 1561 meaningful
02:06:06.000 similarly for article 1562 it states
02:06:09.599 that the government and any Public
02:06:11.040 Authority May exercise the executive
02:06:13.560 authority to protect Safeguard support
02:06:16.500 Foster and promote the institution of
02:06:18.780 marriage
02:06:19.679 again is there a need to state that the
02:06:22.380 government and any Public Authority May
02:06:24.480 exercise their executive Authority it
02:06:27.179 already is the position that under
02:06:28.739 article 23 of the Constitution executive
02:06:31.679 Authority is vested in the president and
02:06:34.199 exercisable by cabinet ministers and
02:06:36.480 other bodies as authorized by law
02:06:39.000 it is arguable then that articles 156 1
02:06:42.840 and 2 do not add anything new to the
02:06:45.659 current position
02:06:47.520 I next move to the second half of the
02:06:49.500 proposed article 156
02:06:51.540 the letter two sub-articles seek to
02:06:53.820 prohibit challenges on the part four of
02:06:55.860 the Constitution to laws and policies
02:06:58.199 based on the current definition of
02:06:59.820 marriage as between a man and a woman
02:07:02.400 I wish to record my concern about the
02:07:05.040 implications of sub-articles 3 and 4 on
02:07:07.920 judicial oversight of the actions of
02:07:09.900 Parliament and the government
02:07:12.119 Advanced stating here that part 4 is the
02:07:15.060 part of the Constitution entitled
02:07:16.619 fundamental liberties
02:07:18.300 it is part four that grants individuals
02:07:20.760 critical protections against abuse of
02:07:22.920 state power such as ensuring freedom
02:07:25.320 from arbitrary arrests and freedom of
02:07:27.179 religion and the right to equal
02:07:28.920 protection under the law these are
02:07:31.560 enshrined in the Constitution for a
02:07:33.239 reason
02:07:34.440 no doubt these fundamental Liberties may
02:07:37.260 not all be absolute and some of them
02:07:39.300 have been qualified in the Constitution
02:07:41.219 itself
02:07:42.360 but if one looks at the existing
02:07:44.099 qualifications they tend to be scoped
02:07:46.380 tightly and Justified on the grounds of
02:07:48.480 national emergencies security public
02:07:51.300 order and public health this was a point
02:07:54.119 that member Mr moralia touched on
02:07:55.860 earlier as well
02:07:57.599 so sir to now include the definition of
02:07:59.820 marriage as something that the courts
02:08:01.320 cannot assess for constitutionality does
02:08:03.840 not appear to me to be justified
02:08:06.179 to clarify I'm not advocating for gay
02:08:08.760 marriages here my concern is purely
02:08:11.219 about whether it is Justified to exclude
02:08:13.320 judicial scrutiny on this topic from a
02:08:16.260 governance standpoint I find this
02:08:17.880 position very difficult to accept
02:08:20.940 under article 93 of the Constitution
02:08:23.159 judicial power has been vested in our
02:08:25.380 courts Article 4 provides that the
02:08:27.840 constitution to the supreme law of the
02:08:29.460 land a point recognized by Minister
02:08:31.260 Marshall goes earlier
02:08:33.300 Article 4 provides that laws passed by
02:08:35.639 Parliament that are inconsistent with
02:08:37.380 the Constitution shall to the extent of
02:08:39.900 the inconsistency be void
02:08:42.239 the Constitution is the fundamental
02:08:44.340 legal Safeguard of citizens to protect
02:08:46.800 them against illegal laws and policies
02:08:48.780 that violate the constitution and it is
02:08:51.239 the job of the courts to assess whether
02:08:52.980 any law is constitutional or not
02:08:55.980 earlier I heard minister massagos in the
02:08:58.500 second reading speech and I would humbly
02:09:00.659 submit that it is not the same thing to
02:09:04.199 say that when the court is assessing a
02:09:06.540 law for constitutionality it is
02:09:08.280 intervening in a political space it is
02:09:10.619 the Court's job to ensure that laws and
02:09:12.900 policies conform with the Constitution
02:09:16.560 will today seeks to exclude the courts
02:09:18.719 from reviewing the constitutionality of
02:09:20.400 laws and policies concerning marriage
02:09:22.619 quite apart from the decision being
02:09:24.239 taken today I'm concerned about what
02:09:26.520 this cover means for the future will the
02:09:28.980 government present or future come up
02:09:31.320 with other areas of life where the
02:09:33.239 courts are to be excluded from reviewing
02:09:35.099 laws and policies for constitutionality
02:09:37.980 will parliament in the future be looking
02:09:39.900 at articles
02:09:41.420 157-158 or 159
02:09:45.000 so it goes without saying that
02:09:46.560 Parliament and the government should
02:09:47.880 instead be ever mindful of what the
02:09:50.280 Constitution requires and act within
02:09:52.500 those parameters to that end I'm very
02:09:55.320 concerned about the implications of this
02:09:57.420 new carve out and what Parliament is
02:09:59.400 asked to do today
02:10:01.440 so to summarize I understand the purpose
02:10:04.260 of article 156 as a quid pro quo for the
02:10:07.199 repeal of section 377a however as far as
02:10:10.619 subparticles 1 and 2 are concerned it
02:10:12.540 does not seem to me that these
02:10:14.340 Provisions add anything to the current
02:10:15.719 position
02:10:16.800 as for articles 1563 and 4 I'm concerned
02:10:20.340 about the courts being further curtailed
02:10:22.380 in their constitutional duty to check
02:10:24.420 Parliament and the government
02:10:25.980 I'm also concerned about whether the
02:10:27.960 covert of judicial oversight on the
02:10:29.880 institution of marriage will set the
02:10:31.739 precedent for future covers even if this
02:10:34.260 is not the intention today
02:10:36.179 this is potentially detrimental to
02:10:38.099 singaporeans
02:10:39.840 that said sir I appreciate the
02:10:41.699 difficulties the government has in
02:10:43.199 navigating this issue of section 377a
02:10:46.199 it is not easy to arrive at a solution
02:10:48.360 that addresses the concerns of society
02:10:50.219 which is divided on the matter
02:10:52.380 to that end I understand the signal the
02:10:54.719 government wishes to send through the
02:10:56.340 proposed article 156. so I will not
02:10:58.920 oppose the bill
02:11:00.360 nevertheless my concerns about
02:11:02.340 safeguarding the courts and doing their
02:11:04.080 constitutional Duty remain for the
02:11:06.659 reasons I've stated I've decided to cast
02:11:09.000 a vote of abstention on the Constitution
02:11:11.159 Amendment bill
02:11:13.980 so Christy Souza
02:11:23.219 Mr Speaker sir thank you for allowing me
02:11:25.739 to speak
02:11:26.940 many members in this house have known my
02:11:29.699 long-standing support for the
02:11:31.560 institutions of marriage and family
02:11:34.560 these institutions deserve continuing
02:11:37.380 protection
02:11:39.119 I must discharge a duty today
02:11:42.119 two questions follow
02:11:44.280 one what is that Duty and two how can I
02:11:48.599 ensure that the carrying out of that
02:11:50.099 Duty Works to the best for Singapore
02:11:54.599 my speech today will answer both those
02:11:57.659 questions
02:11:59.340 for this my starting point is to go back
02:12:02.040 to 1962 and quote Mr Lee Kuan Yew
02:12:07.020 in 1962 Mr Lee Kuan Yew gave a speech to
02:12:10.500 an audience from the University of
02:12:12.719 Singapore
02:12:13.800 the speech was about Law and Order
02:12:17.580 Mr Lee said the phrase should be
02:12:19.500 modified it should read order and law
02:12:23.280 why because Mr Lee's View and I think it
02:12:26.639 is a correct view is that without order
02:12:29.159 then laws become useless
02:12:32.820 allow me to quote Mr Lee
02:12:35.820 quote
02:12:37.560 those of you who are just embarking on
02:12:39.719 the study of the law will learn the
02:12:41.699 phrase Law and Order
02:12:44.699 in a settled and established Society law
02:12:47.820 appears to be a precursor of order
02:12:50.940 good laws lead to good order that is the
02:12:54.239 form that you will learn
02:12:56.460 but the hard realities of keeping the
02:12:58.739 peace between man
02:13:00.420 and man and between Authority and the
02:13:03.060 individual can be more accurately
02:13:05.159 described if the phrase were inverted to
02:13:08.520 order and law
02:13:10.860 for without order the operation of law
02:13:13.679 is impossible unquote
02:13:17.520 mm inverted the phrase Law and Order to
02:13:20.940 become order and law
02:13:23.760 by inverting inverting the phrase he
02:13:26.520 showed how one must establish order
02:13:28.440 first
02:13:29.460 before laws can work
02:13:33.599 why is this a good starting point
02:13:36.480 because what we are debating today is
02:13:39.480 the order of things
02:13:41.460 and the order from which all relevant
02:13:43.679 laws and policies should be construed
02:13:47.639 some use the phrase societal norms
02:13:51.000 some use the phrase social mores
02:13:54.300 I would use the term
02:13:56.400 the Order of Things
02:13:59.219 Mr Speaker we are deciding the order of
02:14:01.920 things today
02:14:03.239 even as we are debating removing a law
02:14:06.000 we are also debating strengthening the
02:14:08.460 order of things by virtue of an
02:14:10.440 amendment to the Constitution
02:14:13.500 that is a very significant move
02:14:17.820 let us pause to think about this
02:14:22.980 we are not just removing a law we are
02:14:25.860 coupling the removal of a law with a
02:14:28.199 with an amendment to the Constitution to
02:14:30.840 protect the order of things and what
02:14:34.139 more the Constitution is not just
02:14:36.360 another law
02:14:37.800 it is the beacon from which all laws
02:14:40.260 take their bearing it sets the tone
02:14:43.440 it is the backbone
02:14:45.179 of the Order of Things
02:14:48.239 do I believe that there is a significant
02:14:50.159 risk that section 377a will be struck
02:14:53.159 down by the courts in a future legal
02:14:54.840 challenge
02:14:56.040 the AG has said so
02:14:58.199 the minister for law has said so
02:15:01.199 these are views that must be taken
02:15:03.480 seriously
02:15:04.560 so I have thought long
02:15:06.840 and hard about this matter and agree
02:15:10.679 that there is a significant risk that
02:15:13.800 section 377a will be struck down by the
02:15:17.280 courts in a future legal challenge
02:15:20.820 so the next question to ask is
02:15:24.719 do we wait
02:15:26.639 or do we move first by shouldering the
02:15:28.920 Legislative responsibility of making
02:15:31.380 hard decisions and deciding on what
02:15:34.139 needs to be protected
02:15:35.820 it is clear in my mind that we must do
02:15:39.540 the latter
02:15:41.520 so Parliament has to act now
02:15:44.340 we must analyze deliberate look into our
02:15:47.280 own selves and make the hard legislative
02:15:49.920 decisions
02:15:51.480 as members of this house we have a duty
02:15:54.060 to decide and reinforce what we desire
02:15:56.040 to protect
02:15:57.239 given the significant risk that section
02:15:59.960 377a may be struck down
02:16:03.540 for this I now turn to the amendments of
02:16:06.300 the Constitution before the house today
02:16:09.659 what does the Constitutional Amendment
02:16:11.639 do
02:16:12.540 the Bill's deaths the legislature May by
02:16:16.440 law Define regulate protect Safeguard
02:16:20.460 support Foster and promote the
02:16:23.940 institution of marriage and then clause
02:16:26.400 three states nothing in part four
02:16:28.760 invalidates a law enacted before on or
02:16:32.160 after the commencement of this bill by
02:16:34.799 reason that the Lord defines marriage as
02:16:38.160 a union between a man and a woman
02:16:43.019 the amendment to the Constitution is
02:16:45.120 clear as to what it seeks to protect
02:16:47.580 I support it why
02:16:50.280 Mr Speaker I believe that the
02:16:52.320 institution of marriage as defined as
02:16:54.478 the union between one man and one woman
02:16:56.580 is the basis upon which our society is
02:17:00.420 built
02:17:01.320 it is something we must protect
02:17:03.718 it must not be diluted
02:17:06.840 marriage is the union of a man and a
02:17:09.299 woman for centuries this Union has been
02:17:12.420 the foundation of societies
02:17:14.700 children and Society
02:17:16.920 as a whole flourish when marriages are
02:17:19.379 supported and the resulting family unit
02:17:22.138 is strong
02:17:23.459 prime minister has said in 2007 2013 and
02:17:28.200 2016 that the traditional family unit
02:17:31.040 should form the basic building block of
02:17:34.620 our society
02:17:36.299 PM stated as recently as three months
02:17:38.820 ago quote we have upheld and reinforced
02:17:41.820 the importance of families through many
02:17:44.218 national policies and we will continue
02:17:46.439 to do so
02:17:47.760 unquote
02:17:49.920 Mr Speaker the amendment to the
02:17:52.379 Constitution strengthens this Foundation
02:17:54.840 it states clearly that marriage is
02:17:57.599 between a man and a woman and it follows
02:18:00.299 that this is the basis on which family
02:18:02.939 is built
02:18:04.558 by constitutionalizing this we are
02:18:07.080 entrenching our values on what is the
02:18:09.840 core the base
02:18:11.879 the order of things from which all other
02:18:14.760 relevant laws and policies in our
02:18:16.620 society take bearing it is the beacon
02:18:19.859 The Guiding guide
02:18:22.620 as a legislator I see this inclusion and
02:18:25.558 amendment to the Constitution as a
02:18:28.080 deliberate and positive step
02:18:30.898 by making this amendment to the
02:18:32.638 Constitution it means that we are also
02:18:35.280 protecting all our social policies that
02:18:37.740 flow from this definition
02:18:40.138 as pm has said in the National Day rally
02:18:43.138 this includes policies on public housing
02:18:46.200 education adoption regulations
02:18:49.280 advertising standards firm
02:18:51.898 classification
02:18:53.459 such a position has been echoed by
02:18:55.439 various Ministries in press statements
02:18:57.780 or by ministers in response to press
02:19:01.200 questions since the national day rally
02:19:05.478 what does this mean
02:19:08.638 one
02:19:09.780 the only form of marriage that is
02:19:11.939 recognized in Singapore is the union
02:19:13.500 between one man and one woman no other
02:19:16.859 form of marriage is recognized in
02:19:18.780 Singapore
02:19:19.799 a religious teacher and usta's Imam
02:19:22.740 priest Pastor Bishop Rabbi or men
02:19:26.160 and women of any religion cannot be
02:19:29.040 prevented from teaching what their faith
02:19:31.799 teaches about marriage and about
02:19:33.718 homosexuality
02:19:35.459 if practicing homosexuality is not
02:19:37.620 condoned in a particular Faith the
02:19:39.959 religious leader can state so
02:19:42.780 two spousal routes spousal rights can
02:19:46.859 only be granted within the context of a
02:19:49.439 heterosexual marriage
02:19:51.300 three education in school particularly
02:19:54.240 sex education should affirm heterosexual
02:19:57.060 marriage as the norm and the bedrocker
02:19:59.520 family there is no room
02:20:02.340 to argue that because section 377a is
02:20:05.160 being repealed that this somehow
02:20:07.320 provides a Gateway or a license to
02:20:09.540 teachers to promote or normalize
02:20:12.000 homosexuality in schools in Singapore
02:20:15.359 their appeal does not provide such a
02:20:19.439 license
02:20:20.960 4. High age ratings will apply to all
02:20:24.240 media that contains homosexual content
02:20:27.080 advertising cannot should content
02:20:30.000 advertising content should not affirm
02:20:32.660 homosexual unions in any way
02:20:35.580 five housing policies will prioritize
02:20:38.520 allocation and grants for married
02:20:40.080 couples and here marriage means a union
02:20:42.960 of a man and a woman
02:20:45.780 six library books for children both
02:20:48.600 physical and digital should not have
02:20:50.880 content depicting or affirming
02:20:52.880 homosexual units
02:20:54.899 seven as for adoption there cannot be a
02:20:58.439 case where a civil union recognized
02:21:00.660 overseas gives a couple in the civil
02:21:03.240 union the ability to adopt under our
02:21:05.399 laws
02:21:07.380 eight and for the complete and for the
02:21:10.800 complete avoidance of Doubt civil unions
02:21:13.500 and civil Partnerships are not
02:21:15.479 recognized in Singapore
02:21:19.080 sir
02:21:20.520 this is not an easy speech for me to
02:21:23.340 deliver
02:21:24.840 I have spoken with people who want
02:21:26.580 section 377a to be retained at all costs
02:21:31.620 they have a right to their View
02:21:34.979 I have spoken with people who want to do
02:21:36.840 away with section 377a and open the
02:21:39.780 gates to changes for all institutions
02:21:42.080 marriage adoption the works
02:21:45.060 they too have the right to hold those
02:21:47.880 views
02:21:49.200 but in the final analysis
02:21:52.020 I have to make my own decision on this
02:21:54.899 difficult issue
02:21:56.280 believe me
02:21:57.660 it is difficult
02:21:59.819 I too have close friends
02:22:02.939 who have same-sex attraction
02:22:07.380 to take a public position on such a
02:22:09.479 difficult issue is not easy
02:22:12.000 but I cannot shy away from facing
02:22:15.899 difficult issues
02:22:17.280 and what I have shared in this speech is
02:22:20.399 my position
02:22:21.660 for Singapore
02:22:23.819 is this decision making a struggle
02:22:26.640 yes
02:22:28.020 but in this struggle is where I belong
02:22:32.160 we
02:22:33.300 all of us here have to make a deep
02:22:35.880 effort to make the right choices in
02:22:38.520 Singapore
02:22:39.720 and for
02:22:41.040 Singapore
02:22:43.920 so with your permission I moved to my
02:22:46.140 second last point
02:22:48.120 what we are debating today in this house
02:22:50.220 on Singapore saw is squarely a domestic
02:22:53.819 issue
02:22:54.720 other countries can choose how they want
02:22:57.600 to shape their societies
02:22:59.399 but other countries should not impose
02:23:01.380 their choices on us no matter how
02:23:03.780 well-meaning they perceive themselves to
02:23:07.439 be
02:23:08.340 speaking plainly let us guard against
02:23:10.920 covert and overt foreign influence in
02:23:15.120 our domestic affairs
02:23:18.300 allow me sir to end with the need for
02:23:20.700 Unity
02:23:22.319 Unity has been a powerful force in
02:23:25.020 modern Singapore's unprecedented history
02:23:27.960 it must remain a part of our future
02:23:30.899 why in my view is the aspect of unity so
02:23:35.460 important today
02:23:37.439 I offer
02:23:38.700 three reasons
02:23:40.560 one
02:23:41.760 there are people in our society who hold
02:23:43.859 strong views on these issues
02:23:46.140 therefore there is a potential here for
02:23:49.200 Singapore to be torn apart by Discord
02:23:53.220 two
02:23:54.479 My Hope Is that singaporeans can discuss
02:23:57.420 our views on these issues peacefully
02:24:00.540 where we disagree
02:24:02.280 let us express such disagreement
02:24:04.200 respectfully
02:24:05.640 and politely
02:24:07.680 what we are doing today in this house is
02:24:10.740 to entrench what we seek to protect and
02:24:13.560 remove a law that has a significant risk
02:24:16.080 of being struck down
02:24:18.359 three
02:24:19.740 by choosing to deal with this in
02:24:22.560 Parliament we are taking a deliberate
02:24:25.040 and considered approach
02:24:27.960 Parliament being made up of elected
02:24:30.300 members has the requisite mandate to
02:24:33.479 deal with these issues and Parliament
02:24:36.000 can do so with dexterity
02:24:40.560 no other institution can carry through
02:24:43.380 such a legislative maneuver
02:24:47.520 it is hoped that the choice of deploying
02:24:50.340 Parliament to deal with this issue is
02:24:53.220 the best path for Unity
02:24:55.920 for our society
02:24:58.080 Unity
02:24:59.700 it is very important
02:25:02.939 so in conclusion while there is no
02:25:05.640 perfect solution I think the formula we
02:25:08.640 are putting forward today both protects
02:25:11.100 what is of vital importance to our
02:25:13.200 nation
02:25:14.160 and give Singapore the best chance
02:25:16.979 at Unity
02:25:18.840 so let the decorum
02:25:21.000 tone and respect that we display during
02:25:24.359 this debate in this house
02:25:26.939 set a good example to all singaporeans
02:25:30.000 of how to deal with such difficult and
02:25:33.720 sensitive issues in future
02:25:36.420 my prayer is that we will not be torn
02:25:39.840 apart
02:25:40.740 by Discord but instead stay United
02:25:45.240 as one nation
02:25:48.060 in all our deliberations present and
02:25:50.939 future
02:25:52.020 in all our debates
02:25:54.000 present and future and in all our
02:25:56.460 decisions
02:25:57.660 present and future let not the unity of
02:26:02.220 our nation
02:26:03.420 be lost
02:26:04.979 thank you very much
02:26:08.760 Miss Hazel Paul
02:26:19.979 Mr Speaker sir
02:26:21.960 the issue of whether 377a should be
02:26:25.080 repealed has been a difficult one for
02:26:27.359 Singapore
02:26:29.040 when I last spoke in Parliament on this
02:26:31.380 issue at the query of Minister shamugam
02:26:33.899 I said that there were two different
02:26:36.060 views within PSP
02:26:38.760 and we had no consensus at that time
02:26:41.399 similar to the situation in our society
02:26:43.920 a lot
02:26:45.720 whilst there is a big group that does
02:26:48.240 not feel very strongly about this issue
02:26:51.000 there is also a significant group that
02:26:53.939 holds very strong and opposing views and
02:26:57.300 they are not easily persuaded
02:26:59.640 we were of the view that any attempts to
02:27:02.700 forcefully reach a single position at
02:27:05.760 that point would be divisive
02:27:09.000 PSP believes that while we strive to
02:27:11.700 establish common ground in core areas
02:27:14.100 for Unity
02:27:15.420 we also need to leave room for diverse
02:27:18.540 viewpoints in other areas
02:27:20.880 therefore we believe that this is one
02:27:22.920 issue where we should allow members to
02:27:26.100 hold on to their personal beliefs
02:27:30.439 societal values evolve with time and
02:27:33.180 laws evolve accordingly let Society at
02:27:36.420 large determine when is the right time
02:27:38.580 to change this law
02:27:41.280 since then we have helped more rounds of
02:27:43.920 lengthy discussions in yet another
02:27:46.020 attempt to seek common ground
02:27:49.080 we recognized the unfairness of 377a on
02:27:53.640 the gay community
02:27:55.439 but we also recognize the fears of many
02:27:58.439 on the subsequent effect on families
02:28:01.740 and the difficulties they face
02:28:04.380 in reconciling with their religious
02:28:06.540 beliefs
02:28:08.340 Our concern is again whether this issue
02:28:11.220 would damage social harmony in Singapore
02:28:14.460 which is something that we value
02:28:18.540 eventually recognizing that 377a is
02:28:22.380 unenfossible some members were prepared
02:28:25.080 to put aside their personal opinions and
02:28:27.720 not pursue their objections to the
02:28:30.420 repeal of 377a
02:28:33.000 with their compromise PSP is now able to
02:28:36.660 come to a party position of supporting
02:28:39.540 the repeal of 377a
02:28:43.200 in any society contentious issues will
02:28:46.740 always arise
02:28:48.060 recognizing that no one single person
02:28:50.640 can have his way all the time and that
02:28:53.640 taking turns to compromise is part and
02:28:56.520 parcel of democracy is a sign of
02:28:59.700 maturity
02:29:01.200 the willingness to compromise
02:29:03.660 is not a sign of weakness but instead
02:29:06.720 one of maturity resilience and Community
02:29:10.200 spirit
02:29:12.180 many singaporeans are concerned about
02:29:14.340 the effect such a repeal will have on
02:29:17.040 the institution of marriage
02:29:20.100 PSP's position is that the definition of
02:29:23.280 marriage should be decided via a
02:29:26.340 national referendum rather than by
02:29:28.680 Parliament
02:29:29.760 this will allow the many singaporeans
02:29:31.920 who have expressed concerns to have a
02:29:34.500 say in the matter
02:29:37.080 the path towards political maturity is
02:29:39.840 filled with gifts and takes from all
02:29:42.000 sides
02:29:43.020 PSP is confident that singaporeans can
02:29:45.420 do it and we will strive towards that
02:29:47.580 direction thank you
02:30:11.280 Mr Speaker sir I have spoken to groups
02:30:15.000 who have the whole spectrum of views on
02:30:18.000 this subject
02:30:19.140 often strongly helped with regards to
02:30:21.979 377a given my roles at the Ministry of
02:30:25.319 Social and family development Ministry
02:30:27.540 of Home Affairs and previously the
02:30:29.939 Ministry of Education
02:30:32.040 I would like to share on the engagements
02:30:34.140 and the feedback from all these various
02:30:36.060 groups and individuals
02:30:38.700 first I have met with groups such as
02:30:42.060 young out here Greenhouse
02:30:44.880 ugachaga sayoni tea project and others
02:30:48.960 who run support groups to help lgbtq
02:30:52.080 plus individuals
02:30:54.240 these ground-up initiatives provide a
02:30:56.939 safe space for their Community to come
02:30:59.220 together and support one another where
02:31:02.100 they can be seen and heard where they
02:31:05.220 are not treated as invisible and where
02:31:08.399 they will not be judged
02:31:10.859 I understand that to the gay community
02:31:13.460 section 377a while not actively enforced
02:31:17.880 is seen as society's judgment
02:31:20.880 of them
02:31:22.200 a rejection of their right to exist
02:31:25.520 criminalizes their right to love and be
02:31:28.380 loved and returned and makes them feel
02:31:30.840 like a lesser citizen
02:31:33.300 it also hangs like the sword of
02:31:35.580 democrits over them since the law exists
02:31:38.880 and reminds them that they are criminals
02:31:41.340 even when what they are engaging in is a
02:31:44.640 private consensual act between two
02:31:47.100 adults
02:31:49.200 lgbtq plus individuals may also suffer
02:31:52.260 from stigma discrimination and be
02:31:55.260 disproportionately impacted by mental
02:31:57.600 health concerns
02:31:59.340 at T projects shelter for their
02:32:01.500 Community I saw how a small shelter for
02:32:05.160 six persons was stacked with suitcases
02:32:08.340 and personal items of about another 10
02:32:11.160 individuals
02:32:13.020 the owners of these items have no
02:32:15.600 permanent airport and move from place to
02:32:18.359 place as their life is often Complicated
02:32:21.180 by mental stress poverty and
02:32:24.120 unemployment
02:32:25.859 in conversations with Greenhouse which
02:32:28.500 runs a support group for 200 plus gay
02:32:31.080 individuals some shared that they have
02:32:34.020 struggled since young to find acceptance
02:32:36.720 from their family
02:32:38.340 but love and acceptance was not
02:32:41.280 forthcoming
02:32:42.780 this has consequences on their physical
02:32:44.819 and mental health ability to find and
02:32:47.399 hold a job and increases their risk of
02:32:49.920 committing offenses and suffering from
02:32:52.380 substance addiction
02:32:54.780 they shared that substance addiction
02:32:56.760 becomes a coping mechanism for them when
02:32:59.760 they are unable to find Acceptance in
02:33:02.100 society
02:33:03.600 we understand their concerns and are
02:33:06.420 working with social service agencies to
02:33:08.819 be open and sensitive to the diverse
02:33:10.800 needs of clients and to provide social
02:33:13.380 support regardless their backgrounds and
02:33:16.439 sexual orientations
02:33:19.200 at the same time I have also spoken to
02:33:22.080 many individuals who are worried about
02:33:24.300 where our society is headed should 377a
02:33:27.899 be repealed
02:33:29.399 in an engagement with over 100 members
02:33:32.100 of the public who had returned to their
02:33:33.780 MPS some youths recounted how they had
02:33:37.800 experienced being ostracized or canceled
02:33:40.380 in schools and universities because they
02:33:43.140 were seen to be conservative and not
02:33:46.140 advocating gay rights
02:33:48.720 others spoke about how they were singled
02:33:51.180 out at their workplaces because they are
02:33:53.700 religious and by default seem to be
02:33:56.399 homophobic and therefore at odds with
02:33:58.859 the company's diversity and inclusion
02:34:01.140 policies
02:34:02.640 I saw a grandmother's hand trembling as
02:34:05.939 she spoke about her grave concerns
02:34:07.800 should Singapore go down the slippery
02:34:10.380 slope as some other countries have after
02:34:12.979 decriminalizing gay sex
02:34:16.020 I would like to clarify that employees
02:34:18.300 are protected against discrimination
02:34:20.340 under the tripartite guidelines for Fair
02:34:22.740 Employment Practices and these
02:34:24.540 guidelines require employers to make
02:34:27.000 employment decisions based on Merit and
02:34:29.580 factors relevant to the job
02:34:31.800 the ministry of Manpower is also looking
02:34:34.260 at enacting workplace fairness
02:34:36.720 legislation
02:34:38.280 on being canceled for one's beliefs the
02:34:41.280 government is looking into policy
02:34:43.020 solutions to preserve space for persons
02:34:46.200 of different views to share what they
02:34:48.300 think safely
02:34:50.100 But ultimately what is important is that
02:34:52.979 we maintain mutual respect when we
02:34:55.200 engage with one another and not tear
02:34:58.140 each other down
02:35:00.359 I also met with leaders of religious
02:35:03.300 groups some of them four to five times
02:35:06.479 they have been steadfast Partners in our
02:35:08.880 nation building
02:35:10.080 they have worked tirelessly to bring
02:35:12.540 singaporeans from different races and
02:35:14.700 religions together to build common
02:35:16.859 spaces and common values
02:35:19.979 the richest leaders shared views from
02:35:22.020 their communities on 377a
02:35:24.660 views anchored on hopes for Singapore to
02:35:27.720 continue to be strong and stable and a
02:35:30.720 place for families
02:35:33.000 many of their congregants have a great
02:35:35.040 sense of gratitude and pride in how far
02:35:38.340 our nation has come and wish for nothing
02:35:40.680 more than for our children and future
02:35:43.020 generations to thrive and prosper and
02:35:46.620 they see the heterosexual family unit as
02:35:49.080 the Bedrock of our society
02:35:52.439 Mr Speaker sir
02:35:54.180 all these individuals gay or straight
02:35:57.780 from different walks of life
02:35:59.700 have stepped forward to share their
02:36:01.439 views because they want to make
02:36:03.359 Singapore a better place a better place
02:36:06.359 for future generations to safeguard
02:36:09.180 Singapore society and Safeguard a
02:36:12.240 community
02:36:13.560 and I want to thank them for being
02:36:15.300 considered in their approach and for
02:36:17.640 sharing the views of the our communities
02:36:19.439 in a constructive manner
02:36:21.479 we have hurt their views and will
02:36:23.939 continue to work with them to navigate A
02:36:26.939 Way Forward
02:36:28.979 the two bills that stand before us today
02:36:31.020 allow us to repeal 377a in a careful and
02:36:34.560 considered way
02:36:35.939 the issue that stands before us is one
02:36:38.700 of public policy as to whether gay sex
02:36:41.399 in the context of private sexual
02:36:44.160 behavior between consenting adults
02:36:46.260 should remain a crime under Singapore
02:36:48.899 laws
02:36:50.399 having heard the views from various
02:36:52.439 parties the two bills have been drafted
02:36:54.899 with great care and aimed to address
02:36:57.359 their concerns
02:36:59.399 a that the majority of singaporeans
02:37:02.040 still want the heterosexual family
02:37:04.200 structure as Norm
02:37:06.420 B most accept that private consensual
02:37:09.300 sex between men should not be
02:37:10.859 criminalized
02:37:12.300 C for those who are against the repeal
02:37:14.819 the main concern is about what the
02:37:16.859 repeat would mean for social norms and
02:37:19.140 not that they want to criminalize sex
02:37:21.120 between men
02:37:23.580 though the bills are voted on separately
02:37:25.800 they should be seen holistically because
02:37:28.920 this is not a zero-sum game where one
02:37:32.340 side wins and the other side loses
02:37:35.640 and in the spirit of how the two bills
02:37:38.100 are drafted we hope that singaporeans
02:37:40.500 with all their varied views on the issue
02:37:43.200 can be United in our desire to find
02:37:45.840 common ground so that we can move
02:37:47.520 forward together
02:37:49.500 let us be United in wanting Singapore to
02:37:52.620 be a home for all a tolerant and
02:37:55.319 inclusive Society where all singaporeans
02:37:58.140 feel a sense of dignity and have
02:38:00.899 Collective confidence in our future

02:48:50.460 I will focus my speech on two main areas
02:48:53.700 the legal context behind the necessity
02:48:57.000 for the repeal of section 377a which I
02:49:00.120 will deliver in Malay and the need to
02:49:02.819 support families and especially parents
02:49:05.520 and Educators in navigating the post
02:49:08.220 repeal of section 377a in Malay

02:54:11.460 Mr Speaker sir
02:54:13.140 this bill sends a signal that everyone
02:54:16.319 must be equally protected under the law
02:54:19.680 at the same time the amendment to the
02:54:22.500 Constitution clarifies parliament's role
02:54:25.560 to protect Safeguard support Foster and
02:54:29.640 promote the institution of marriage the
02:54:32.819 new article
02:54:33.920 156 subsection 3 protects from a
02:54:38.399 constitutional challenge the laws
02:54:40.740 defining marriage as a union between a
02:54:43.740 man and a woman and also laws and
02:54:46.140 policies based on a heterosexual
02:54:48.359 definition of marriage
02:54:50.720 notwithstanding this I've met many
02:54:53.100 residents in cat Hong and choa chukang
02:54:55.200 and members from various organizations
02:54:57.779 and Charities including Malay Muslim
02:55:00.720 organizations who are uncertain as to
02:55:04.020 what the future changes these amendments
02:55:06.840 will bring
02:55:08.399 I think it is important to actively
02:55:11.399 engage families and parents on this
02:55:14.399 issue and provide them with various
02:55:16.740 Avenues of counseling or parenting
02:55:18.479 support the same goes for our teachers
02:55:21.359 and Educators too
02:55:23.220 for the Muslim Community a common
02:55:25.560 feedback from mosque or organization
02:55:27.899 leaders is that there is a need for
02:55:30.660 clearer guidelines or capability
02:55:32.939 training
02:55:34.260 the new article 156 subsection 2 states
02:55:38.279 that the government and public
02:55:40.319 authorities mean in the exercise of the
02:55:43.020 executive Authority promote the
02:55:45.600 institution of marriage through public
02:55:47.819 housing education and media policies
02:55:50.040 that promote and Safeguard the
02:55:52.260 institution of marriage in this regard
02:55:54.240 may I ask what are the plans of the
02:55:57.120 government to achieve this stated
02:55:58.979 objective to promote and Safeguard the
02:56:01.979 institution of marriage and in
02:56:03.660 particular whether there are any plans
02:56:06.000 to provide or families especially
02:56:09.180 parents with counseling or parenting
02:56:11.640 support
02:56:13.140 in this regard such parenting support or
02:56:15.720 counseling should also provide for a
02:56:18.720 faith or value-based support if such is
02:56:21.840 available so that the individuals
02:56:24.080 concerned would choose what suits them
02:56:26.700 best
02:56:28.080 also it is important to preserve the
02:56:31.380 freedom of conscience in our schools
02:56:33.600 businesses and religious institutions so
02:56:37.080 that our fellow singaporeans are free to
02:56:40.080 practice their belief their faith or
02:56:43.200 otherwise without any fear of
02:56:45.779 cancellation or reprisals against them
02:56:49.260 I welcome the announcement by Minister
02:56:51.960 Sean mugam and also by MOS suntrailing
02:56:54.899 just now that the Ministries and
02:56:56.700 agencies are looking into this may I ask
02:56:59.819 whether there is an update and whether a
02:57:02.160 consultation feedback process will be
02:57:04.140 undertaken
02:57:05.819 in conclusion Mr Speaker sir
02:57:08.399 we need to continue to stand United
02:57:10.859 together as fellow singaporeans despite
02:57:14.640 our differences in faith values or
02:57:17.520 belief let us not let this issue divide
02:57:21.060 us but instead unite us thank you

02:57:38.640 Mr Speaker
02:57:40.260 today the house is debating the
02:57:42.240 government's Amendment Bill to repeal
02:57:43.859 section 300a of the penal code
02:57:46.620 and a proposed Amendment of the
02:57:48.060 Constitution to insert the new article
02:57:49.620 156 relating to the institution of
02:57:52.319 marriage
02:57:53.340 in 2007 prime minister Lisa long said
02:57:55.859 that the government will not proactively
02:57:57.420 enforce section 377a and that has been
02:58:00.600 the position since then for the record I
02:58:03.180 still agree with the previous position
02:58:04.500 of the government in non-enforcing
02:58:06.660 section 377a
02:58:08.880 since the government announced that
02:58:10.500 you'll be repealing section 377a of the
02:58:12.899 penal code and after the subsequent
02:58:14.340 announcement of the proposed
02:58:16.020 constitutional law amendments I received
02:58:18.540 feedback and spoken to many residents
02:58:20.399 and singaporeans of different races
02:58:23.100 religions and ages
02:58:25.740 I've heard and read the views of members
02:58:28.260 of the lgbtq community particularly the
02:58:31.680 unhappiness with perceived
02:58:33.240 discrimination and different rights as
02:58:35.580 compared to heterosexual couples in the
02:58:38.100 in the areas of marriage owning btos
02:58:40.680 rights of child adoption Etc
02:58:43.439 I also heard much feedback from
02:58:45.120 residents and singaporeans of their
02:58:47.160 concerns for the repeal many were
02:58:49.740 concerned that we would be removing a
02:58:52.080 symbolic social marker by such a repeat
02:58:55.620 people are also concerned with the
02:58:57.479 societal changes they have seen in many
02:58:59.880 countries in the areas of gender
02:59:01.620 identity sex education marriage laws and
02:59:05.220 public policy and with the repeal some
02:59:08.700 will press for more changes in law and
02:59:10.740 policy after the repeal like what is
02:59:12.899 seen in other countries
02:59:14.340 for example in Australia and the US and
02:59:17.279 they wanted to extend the proposed
02:59:18.960 amendments to the Constitution can
02:59:20.819 prevent such changes
02:59:24.720 many Express concern that the removal of
02:59:27.899 such a marker may make it difficult for
02:59:29.580 parents in setting down their family and
02:59:31.740 social values at home many are also
02:59:34.500 concerned there will be they will be
02:59:36.120 stopped from expressing their contrary
02:59:38.040 views on sexuality after the repeal
02:59:40.800 including the fear of being canceled
02:59:43.260 some are concerned that they will be
02:59:44.880 name calling because you they take a
02:59:46.560 view on sexuality in their workplace or
02:59:49.200 for young people and children in their
02:59:51.240 schools
02:59:52.260 people are also concerned that more
02:59:53.939 changes will make Society more divided
02:59:56.819 Mr Speaker some who are concerned with
02:59:58.680 the repeal of the view that the present
03:00:00.420 position in law
03:00:01.859 would represent the best balance the
03:00:04.680 singaporeans have spoken to or have
03:00:06.660 written to me with their reservations
03:00:08.399 include those whose views may not be
03:00:10.680 influenced by any religious views and
03:00:13.380 also those of a wide age range
03:00:16.560 Mr Speaker I have considered different
03:00:18.660 views and positions many of which
03:00:21.180 we have heard and we built here in the
03:00:23.340 house today
03:00:24.420 the proposed review presents a number of
03:00:26.520 difficult issues for different group of
03:00:27.779 singaporeans the symbolism of Section 3
03:00:30.600 Samsung e is different to different
03:00:32.279 groups they are referring views and even
03:00:34.979 the experiences of individuals
03:00:38.340 as an MP in considering all issues I'm
03:00:40.439 also Guided by my own conscience in
03:00:42.840 arriving at a position that I feel is
03:00:44.640 right for our society and our people
03:00:46.680 even if some may disagree even as I do
03:00:49.500 my best to analyze the issues for
03:00:51.479 different segments of our population and
03:00:53.880 my constituents tourism of my own
03:00:56.279 conscience has Guided by my own faith
03:00:58.740 and beliefs I find it difficult to
03:01:01.439 support the repeal of Section 3 Samsung
03:01:03.420 a I am personally troubled by the
03:01:06.060 removal of the marker that he represents
03:01:08.939 Mr Speaker this has not been an easy
03:01:11.460 decision for me because as an MP I would
03:01:14.220 like to represent all constituents as
03:01:16.620 best as I can
03:01:18.000 I thank my party Whip and party
03:01:19.620 Secretary General and leader of the
03:01:21.720 opposition become Singh for lifting the
03:01:23.279 whip I do not take this lightly in fact
03:01:26.279 I made this decision with a heavy heart
03:01:28.800 this is both a most difficult decision
03:01:30.840 and it's the most difficult speech I
03:01:32.760 Have to make today given the divided
03:01:35.279 issues at play for different segments of
03:01:37.260 our my constituents and for singaporeans
03:01:40.680 being very careful not to cause hurt or
03:01:42.899 fans and yet having to be principled
03:01:44.640 with my own beliefs it is also not made
03:01:47.340 easier because like many fellow MPS and
03:01:49.380 singaporeans I also have many friends
03:01:51.840 and good good friends who are from the
03:01:53.880 lgbtq community and some have over time
03:01:56.819 shared with me some of their very
03:01:58.380 difficult circumstances and experiences
03:02:01.439 in life which makes my decision today
03:02:03.960 even more difficult and humbling I
03:02:07.200 humbly seek their understanding
03:02:09.060 Mr Speaker a conscious vote is a very
03:02:12.180 heavy responsibility A Member of
03:02:14.340 Parliament is required to discharge
03:02:15.960 because it is a responsibility each of
03:02:18.540 us carries a loan
03:02:20.520 Guided by our own conscience
03:02:25.020 Mr Speaker next on the issue of the
03:02:27.300 Constitutional Amendment my colleague
03:02:29.399 and my honorable friend Mr William has
03:02:31.920 raised some concerns regarding the
03:02:33.240 implications of the proposed crops out
03:02:35.640 cuff outs in the proposed article on 153
03:02:39.000 to exclude the Court's role in ensuring
03:02:41.279 Conformity with the Constitution why
03:02:44.100 agree that her concerns have some merits
03:02:46.500 and I look forward to the government's
03:02:48.240 assurances on these issues
03:02:50.760 hmm
03:02:53.399 I would still support the Amendments for
03:02:55.439 the reason that as the government is
03:02:57.120 minded to push through the repeal of
03:02:58.979 section 377a if the repeal were to
03:03:02.100 proceed without the proposed
03:03:03.960 Constitutional Amendments those who have
03:03:06.359 reservations about the repeal may be
03:03:08.100 even more concerned that there will be
03:03:10.620 no other enhancement in law to address
03:03:12.540 their concerns
03:03:15.660 quite close I'd like to thank many of my
03:03:17.640 constituents and many singaporeans who
03:03:19.920 wrote to me and who spoke to me about
03:03:21.540 the proposed repeal of section 377a
03:03:24.600 including both
03:03:26.340 uh the groups who support the repeal and
03:03:29.160 those who object to the review I also
03:03:31.319 like to seek the understanding of my
03:03:32.520 constituents in singaporeans who may not
03:03:34.200 agree in my decision the position I take
03:03:36.540 today does not change how I treat all my
03:03:39.180 constituents and all singaporeans I will
03:03:41.640 continue to serve all my constituents to
03:03:43.620 the best of my ability moving forward I
03:03:46.200 hope for greater understanding
03:03:48.180 between those who share different views
03:03:49.979 on LGBT LGBT and greater tolerance of
03:03:53.399 different views we may not always agree
03:03:55.620 with each other on every issue but we
03:03:57.840 can and should agree to disagree we
03:04:00.420 should still love and respect each other
03:04:02.220 no less as fellow human beings and I
03:04:05.340 hope that there will be more dialogue
03:04:06.600 between those who share different views
03:04:08.160 so that there may be a better
03:04:09.779 understanding and less polarization
03:04:13.439 Mr Speaker I oppose the Pinnacle
03:04:15.420 Amendment bill that will support the
03:04:17.040 Constitutional Amendment Bill thank you
03:04:21.359 professor
03:04:35.340 Mr Speaker
03:04:37.740 each individual
03:04:39.899 functions within a society
03:04:42.540 so there is a place for public debate
03:04:45.899 about the laws and institutions
03:04:49.319 which we would want to have in order to
03:04:52.439 regulate life within their society
03:04:56.100 at one level
03:04:57.720 I believe that this debate
03:05:00.899 is about whether the family
03:05:03.479 defined as a marriage between the
03:05:05.700 heterosexual couple
03:05:07.560 and their Parenthood
03:05:09.479 is the unit that forms the basic
03:05:12.920 structure of a well-ordered society
03:05:17.580 children are born into families
03:05:20.880 and develop their complete lives with
03:05:23.760 the investment of the parents who gave
03:05:25.740 birth to them
03:05:27.600 if we view the family as Justified as
03:05:32.160 part of the basic structure of society
03:05:35.160 then we would want to have laws and
03:05:37.880 institutions that support that family
03:05:42.060 we would want to strengthen this social
03:05:44.279 Norm
03:05:45.479 and support the public commitment made
03:05:48.300 by a man and a woman
03:05:50.279 to be married to each other
03:05:52.380 and to raise their children
03:05:54.540 within the safety of their wedding vow
03:05:58.680 playing their complementary roles
03:06:01.740 fathers and mothers raise their children
03:06:06.120 who contribute to the orderly formation
03:06:09.359 and further reproduction of society over
03:06:12.960 many generations
03:06:15.899 research shows that the cognitive and
03:06:20.100 the social emotional skills that are
03:06:22.979 acquired in early childhood
03:06:26.040 and that their development is very much
03:06:29.040 shaped by the family environment
03:06:32.340 what it has to be acknowledged that
03:06:34.800 there are major challenges that couples
03:06:37.560 will have got to tackle
03:06:39.600 in order to keep their marriages healthy
03:06:42.600 and to provide the best environment to
03:06:45.060 raise their children
03:06:47.399 our laws and institutions must help to
03:06:50.700 strengthen the culture
03:06:52.439 where husbands and wives give priority
03:06:56.040 to building strong families even when
03:06:58.920 couples are economically disadvantaged
03:07:01.140 public policy through early
03:07:03.420 interventions in their children's lives
03:07:05.880 can help to improve social Mobility
03:07:08.240 Society can then uplift the quality of
03:07:11.880 life for future generations of citizens
03:07:14.399 by supporting the husband and wife in
03:07:18.000 their child rearing activities
03:07:20.760 Singapore has made a transition from an
03:07:23.220 economy built around factories that
03:07:26.460 produce standard labor-intensive goods
03:07:28.500 for sale into the World Market the one
03:07:30.960 that is more service oriented
03:07:33.779 and we're the fourth Industrial
03:07:35.340 Revolution will require workers to
03:07:38.460 exercise a wide range of both cognitive
03:07:41.640 and non-cognitive skills in such an
03:07:44.220 economy
03:07:45.479 I believe that family Remains the
03:07:48.000 Bedrock of society where children born
03:07:51.000 where children learn complementary
03:07:53.819 lessons from their fathers and their
03:07:56.700 mothers so that they develop the skills
03:07:59.640 needed to become well-functioning future
03:08:03.660 workers
03:08:05.700 we take for granted that as our parents
03:08:08.580 have invested in our lives it is our
03:08:11.340 responsibility to provide care for them
03:08:13.680 when they become old
03:08:16.859 that responsibility is shared among
03:08:19.080 siblings
03:08:20.580 even when there are failures in
03:08:22.500 particular cases we hold as examples
03:08:25.260 those who as those who Inspire us with
03:08:28.380 their Devotion to duty to the care
03:08:31.920 of the Aging parents
03:08:33.899 while the government trees public
03:08:35.819 programs provides assistance in various
03:08:38.220 forms much of the glue that holds a
03:08:40.859 society together comes from the
03:08:43.200 constituent members within the family
03:08:47.760 we should one
03:08:49.680 in instituting
03:08:52.140 our laws to convey to all means possible
03:08:55.740 the Gratitude we feel for the
03:08:58.200 complementary roles
03:09:00.060 that our fathers and mothers play in
03:09:02.279 raising us to become well-functioning
03:09:04.680 adults departing from this Norm or what
03:09:08.279 constitutes a family I believe leaves us
03:09:10.260 in uncharted waters Mr Speaker
03:09:13.620 the government has reiterated that he
03:09:16.020 has no intention to change the tone of
03:09:18.240 society
03:09:19.439 is it also affirms I quote the family as
03:09:23.279 the Cornerstone of our social Fabric and
03:09:26.399 marriage between a man and a woman and a
03:09:29.580 quote
03:09:31.380 a strategy to redefine what constitutes
03:09:35.160 a family
03:09:37.080 from what the government has reaffirmed
03:09:39.000 as marriage between a man and a woman
03:09:40.920 and their Parenthood
03:09:43.560 involves taking sequential steps to
03:09:46.800 progressively bring about change
03:09:49.800 in many historical cases around the
03:09:52.439 world
03:09:53.279 where the structure of the family has
03:09:55.319 been changed from the norm that the
03:09:57.359 government has reaffirmed
03:09:59.180 legislative changes have indeed taken
03:10:02.279 place sequentially beginning with
03:10:06.479 the decriminalization similar to uh the
03:10:11.819 repeal of the law we are discussing
03:10:13.620 today to subsequently defining the
03:10:17.520 family in a very different way
03:10:19.560 from the basic structure of the family
03:10:22.640 just mentioned
03:10:27.000 these changes this like legislative
03:10:29.819 changes
03:10:31.200 make the definition an institution of
03:10:33.779 marriage both contingent
03:10:35.760 and subject to change
03:10:38.520 I believe
03:10:40.500 that not repealing the law asks to
03:10:43.380 bolster the achieving of the aims of the
03:10:45.479 government to keep the family form out
03:10:48.240 of a marriage between a man and a woman
03:10:50.160 as a Cornerstone of a social fabric for
03:10:53.700 as long as possible in the face of the
03:10:56.279 many challenges to such an understanding
03:10:58.560 of the family as the unit that forms the
03:11:02.100 basic structure of society
03:11:04.620 I believe that keeping the current law
03:11:06.979 serves to provide an important marker to
03:11:11.220 preserve the present structure of the
03:11:12.899 family any supporting Institution
03:11:16.439 I believe that it is best not to repute
03:11:19.380 the law
03:11:20.399 thank you
03:11:23.399 Mr family man
03:11:29.760 speaker sir I'll be speaking in Malay

03:17:41.000 thank you
03:17:46.140 Mr leonbergero
03:17:49.380 Mr Speaker so I'd like to start by
03:17:51.899 asking a simple question
03:17:53.819 what if you were born into a world where
03:17:57.120 your actions Mark you out as being in a
03:17:59.160 minority because most people don't want
03:18:01.439 to do what you do
03:18:03.240 an unpopular minority what if you were
03:18:05.700 able to live your life in the society
03:18:07.560 you were born into but the back of your
03:18:10.020 mind you could never get over this
03:18:11.880 niggling fear this fear that one day the
03:18:14.640 majority might turn against you might
03:18:16.560 bully you may discriminate against you
03:18:18.120 or worse
03:18:19.260 each of us can close our eyes and
03:18:21.479 imagine that we live in such a world
03:18:24.660 and then imagine a different world a
03:18:26.520 different situation imagine that you
03:18:28.620 hold dearly to a Viewpoint as a matter
03:18:30.779 of conscience a Viewpoint that others
03:18:32.580 believe is deeply offensive and hurtful
03:18:35.220 even though to you it is a view that
03:18:37.439 does not call for her towards any other
03:18:39.240 human being
03:18:40.380 rather it is a view about what sorts of
03:18:42.540 behaviors should be held up as moral
03:18:44.160 markers in our society imagine that you
03:18:46.740 cannot speak about that point of view
03:18:48.240 that you hold on pain of being canceled
03:18:51.920 abused or attacked on social media or
03:18:54.899 worse
03:18:55.979 each of us can close our eyes and
03:18:57.779 imagine that we live in such a world too
03:19:01.380 so proponents of either side in the 377a
03:19:04.200 debate May identify with either one or
03:19:06.420 the other scenario or perhaps some may
03:19:08.760 identify with both scenarios at once
03:19:11.040 that is what is at stake in this debate
03:19:13.740 are we to be divided between people who
03:19:15.660 cherish the freedom to act in a certain
03:19:17.160 way versus those who cherish the freedom
03:19:18.899 to espouse views that are deep matters
03:19:21.000 of conscience and never the twain shall
03:19:22.920 meet will this be an unbridgeable chasm
03:19:25.439 in our Singapore
03:19:27.000 we've seen what such divisions about
03:19:28.740 values can do in other countries we can
03:19:30.779 look at the culture wars in the USA for
03:19:32.939 example an off-goated example where
03:19:34.680 differences in values often with
03:19:36.660 religious Dimension have become
03:19:38.819 political and polarizing another example
03:19:40.680 possibly is turkey where differences in
03:19:42.660 values with the religious Dimension
03:19:43.859 about huge political ramifications in
03:19:46.319 the past and still do
03:19:47.880 politics is and should be about the
03:19:49.620 contest of ideas robust respectful
03:19:51.600 debate about what is best for the
03:19:53.220 country is a good thing as most
03:19:54.720 singaporeans would probably agree these
03:19:56.640 days the truth what is best for our
03:19:59.100 country in our time emerges from such
03:20:01.140 disagreement other things are needed for
03:20:03.540 political progress but there can be no
03:20:06.240 progress without respectful robust
03:20:08.220 political debate
03:20:09.720 but major political divides around
03:20:11.580 values around matters of conscience and
03:20:13.800 religion are a different matter
03:20:15.960 to some extent such debates are often
03:20:18.300 impossible to settle with reference to
03:20:20.580 an agreed set of facts
03:20:23.279 so as we try to path forward on these
03:20:25.140 issues before the house today before the
03:20:27.540 country today it is worth recalling a
03:20:29.460 few truths that almost no one would
03:20:31.620 disagree with on either side of the
03:20:33.180 questions before us let's recall a few
03:20:35.279 things that unite us
03:20:37.380 firstly singaporeans will have to decide
03:20:40.140 these debates ourselves the Touchstone
03:20:42.779 in our hearts should be what is best for
03:20:45.180 and what is possible in this country we
03:20:48.000 love not some other country we know
03:20:50.340 about
03:20:51.300 secondly I believe that no one in this
03:20:53.640 debate is calling for the active
03:20:55.620 enforcement of 377a I know that this is
03:20:59.160 the case for my colleagues in the
03:21:00.479 workers party you have a different view
03:21:01.800 from mine on 377a and with whom I've had
03:21:05.160 many Lively and meaningful discussions
03:21:07.140 from which I have learned a great deal I
03:21:09.420 suspect that this would be the case for
03:21:10.979 all other members of this house
03:21:12.960 who can be taken to represent the
03:21:15.120 political mainstream
03:21:17.040 let's stop and reflect on that for a
03:21:19.380 second
03:21:20.460 that is hugely important no one is
03:21:22.920 saying discrimination is okay no one is
03:21:25.680 saying bullying is okay no one is saying
03:21:28.200 violence is okay that is what unites the
03:21:30.660 vast majority
03:21:32.040 some On The Fringe on either side may
03:21:34.020 not agree but no one in the mainstream
03:21:35.760 disagrees despite the worst fears in my
03:21:38.220 humble opinions the middle ground on
03:21:40.500 this issue is strong
03:21:42.540 and Mr Speaker sir given that no one is
03:21:44.640 calling for the active enforcement of
03:21:46.140 377a in this debate
03:21:48.060 as we move on to unpack the issues we
03:21:51.180 must hold fast in our hearts to that
03:21:53.040 realization because it is a truth that
03:21:55.380 unifies and heals and strengthens
03:21:57.660 so what then is at stake if it is not
03:21:59.819 practical enforcement
03:22:01.740 what is at stake is the existence of
03:22:04.460 377a on our statute books as a moral
03:22:07.800 marker as a symbolic marker and as I
03:22:10.979 said in my recent speech on National
03:22:12.359 symbols the debate is not less important
03:22:15.420 for that reason
03:22:16.800 it is far from trivial it is important
03:22:19.560 because symbols matter
03:22:22.260 Mr Speaker so what divides Us in this
03:22:24.120 debate is whether to keep or throw out
03:22:25.620 377a in our body of law
03:22:28.200 but I would like to argue that there is
03:22:29.880 another issue that divides us which is a
03:22:32.160 subtext to the debate a subliminal
03:22:34.260 Factor if you like
03:22:35.640 and that is the concern that if 377a is
03:22:38.520 repealed and that moral marker is no
03:22:40.380 longer will those who do not view lgbtq
03:22:43.680 plus relationships as being consonant
03:22:45.420 with their own personal values will such
03:22:47.580 people be canceled from expressing their
03:22:49.500 view will the expression of their views
03:22:51.420 say its religious views for example be
03:22:53.340 considered to be acts of hatred and
03:22:56.040 discrimination
03:22:57.300 in explaining my own vote today I would
03:22:59.220 like to address both these issues in
03:23:00.779 turn
03:23:01.680 before I do so I would like to record my
03:23:04.140 thanks to the leader of the opposition
03:23:05.279 for lifting the whip in this debate and
03:23:07.680 thus allowing Workers Party MPS to speak
03:23:09.420 and vote according to their conscience
03:23:11.340 and deeply held values Workers Party MPS
03:23:14.100 do have a majority view but they support
03:23:16.380 the right of each MP to vote according
03:23:18.359 to their conscience on retaining or
03:23:20.760 repealing 377a as a moral marker
03:23:24.660 so you don't get an issue that is more
03:23:26.340 entwined with conscience than this
03:23:28.500 yet as I said earlier no one in WP is
03:23:32.279 calling for 377a to be actively enforced
03:23:36.720 Mr Speaker so I'd like to move on to my
03:23:39.060 own view on repealing 377a I support the
03:23:42.120 repeal first I would like to talk about
03:23:43.979 the rightful place of the law in
03:23:45.600 policing private acts between consenting
03:23:47.700 adults
03:23:48.779 my own view is that there is a public
03:23:50.160 sphere where the law has the right to
03:23:51.960 intervene in private behavior that has
03:23:53.880 public consequences even when that
03:23:56.220 private behavior is consensual and the
03:23:58.080 part of all participants for example we
03:24:00.540 have the offensive statutory rape where
03:24:02.220 sex with a minor is criminalized the
03:24:04.439 miner may have consented but the law
03:24:06.359 recognizes that the miner does not have
03:24:08.279 the maturity to meaningfully consent and
03:24:11.100 I agree with this most of us would
03:24:13.200 but my own view is that the law has no
03:24:15.060 place to intervene private Behavior
03:24:16.859 among truly consenting adults provided
03:24:18.899 there is no other public consequence
03:24:20.819 thrown up
03:24:22.200 so I received feedback from a number of
03:24:24.120 singaporeans including my own
03:24:25.439 constituents who believe that consenting
03:24:28.020 lgbtq plus relationships do do have such
03:24:31.200 public implications
03:24:33.420 for example some have made points about
03:24:35.580 public health
03:24:36.899 some about our ability to reproduce as a
03:24:40.080 nation some about the undesirability of
03:24:42.779 importing liberal values from the west
03:24:45.060 and so on
03:24:46.739 however let's recall this is a debate
03:24:49.140 about keeping or throwing out 377a as a
03:24:51.779 symbolic marker
03:24:53.160 not about actively enforcing it where
03:24:56.220 there is no disagreement
03:24:57.960 if we retain 377a as a symbolic marker
03:25:01.260 should we also introduce other laws into
03:25:03.660 the statute books as symbolic markers
03:25:05.880 without enforcement such as for example
03:25:08.880 for illustrative purposes laws
03:25:10.560 encouraging healthier sexual behavior or
03:25:13.080 laws encouraging singaporeans to have
03:25:14.760 enough children to lift our total
03:25:16.620 fertility rate who lost to a
03:25:18.600 post-liberal cultural ideas
03:25:20.760 I do not think we should and I do not
03:25:22.500 believe anyone is calling for this
03:25:24.779 therefore by the same token there is a
03:25:26.760 case to repeal 377a as unnecessary
03:25:29.220 because symbolic markers are not
03:25:31.319 inserted into our body of laws for other
03:25:33.359 issues of importance
03:25:35.640 and also because free and respectful
03:25:38.700 conversation about symbolic markers can
03:25:40.560 and should continue completely
03:25:42.060 independently of the law and criminal
03:25:43.920 penalties such respectful conversations
03:25:46.380 have a place I shall return to this
03:25:48.960 in the later part of my speech there are
03:25:51.300 other better ways to register our views
03:25:53.100 on matters of conscience ways that are
03:25:55.200 pursued outside of the realm of laws and
03:25:57.239 criminal penalties
03:25:59.640 so my next argument for supporting a
03:26:01.260 reveal of 377a a repeal of 377a sorry is
03:26:04.500 that retaining a law that is not
03:26:05.939 actively enforced based on the word of
03:26:08.460 the government of the day is
03:26:10.200 unsatisfactory and dangerous
03:26:12.239 no doubt the current government has
03:26:13.739 declared that it will not proactively
03:26:15.239 inform
03:26:22.500 a future government an agency to reverse
03:26:24.899 the stance more importantly
03:26:27.239 a future government and AGC to reverse
03:26:29.700 this stance more importantly
03:26:32.040 such an approach to the law in my mind
03:26:34.620 places too much power in the hands of
03:26:37.140 the government and AGC to decide what
03:26:39.600 laws should be enforced and what laws
03:26:41.760 should absolutely not be enforced it
03:26:44.340 leaves too much to prosecutorial
03:26:46.560 discretion and too little to the
03:26:49.020 rightful province of parliament in
03:26:51.180 making these laws in the courts to
03:26:53.819 interpret them
03:26:55.500 keep a law that has a serious impact on
03:26:58.020 the lives of many singaporeans on the
03:27:00.420 basis that it is a marker that will not
03:27:02.760 be enforced by the current government
03:27:04.680 is not in my opinion how we should go
03:27:07.680 about making good laws
03:27:09.540 markers can be created and conveyed
03:27:11.700 respectfully in other ways without
03:27:13.140 incorporating them into our laws
03:27:17.279 which brings me to the last part of my
03:27:19.020 speech on 377a the part that addresses
03:27:21.300 the subtext
03:27:22.859 will removing 377a mean that in the
03:27:25.800 wider Society those of a religious
03:27:28.260 persuasion or who are otherwise
03:27:29.640 persuaded cannot express their views
03:27:31.979 freely about lgbtq plus relationships
03:27:35.580 which may be prescribed in religious
03:27:37.260 faith
03:27:38.700 so the freedom of religion is protected
03:27:41.160 under our Constitution Article 15
03:27:43.279 protects the right of each Singaporean
03:27:46.080 to profess practice and propagate their
03:27:48.540 religion freedom of speech is also
03:27:50.460 protected by article 14 1 of our
03:27:52.500 constitution in making these arguments
03:27:54.779 about 377a I also want to make another
03:27:56.819 argument
03:27:57.840 those who question lgbtq relationships
03:28:00.120 on the grounds of religion or other
03:28:01.560 considerations rooted in personal
03:28:03.660 conviction should be free to express
03:28:05.939 their views respectfully as I said
03:28:08.399 earlier the mainstream of opinion among
03:28:10.739 singaporeans want to retain 377a is not
03:28:13.800 to call for its active enforcement and
03:28:15.479 not to condone bullying or
03:28:16.620 discrimination against lgbtq individuals
03:28:20.640 of any kind
03:28:21.840 this is a huge point in favor of the
03:28:24.120 Common Ground the Strong Middle in this
03:28:25.920 debate and I would argue that as the
03:28:28.140 mirror image of that
03:28:30.239 those who question lgbtq relationships
03:28:32.700 on the grounds of religious Faith or
03:28:34.200 deep personal conviction should have the
03:28:35.580 freedom to espouse their views
03:28:37.200 respectfully making clear that they
03:28:39.180 regard everyone equally as a citizen but
03:28:41.220 the Hue to their deep personal
03:28:43.080 convictions on this matter
03:28:45.300 they should not be canceled it should
03:28:47.520 not be demonized to criticize a choice
03:28:50.700 someone makes in their personal life is
03:28:52.319 not tantamount to criticizing
03:28:54.540 denigrating or disenfranchising that
03:28:56.880 person but this depends of course on how
03:28:59.160 that criticism is made I recognize that
03:29:02.460 already as it stands some religious
03:29:04.380 teachings do constitute criticisms of
03:29:06.239 certain acts not deemed illegal
03:29:09.660 likewise those of a different persuasion
03:29:11.700 those who believe in lgbtq equality have
03:29:13.800 the right to respectfully criticize
03:29:15.239 opposing views
03:29:18.120 is such respectful speech where we agree
03:29:21.359 to disagree if impossible I will return
03:29:23.939 to this topic in the last part of my
03:29:25.500 speech today
03:29:26.700 before I leave the subject of repealing
03:29:28.380 377a Mr Speaker so I must say that it is
03:29:31.739 my personal conviction that every
03:29:33.300 individual should be treated equally
03:29:34.859 regardless of sexual orientation why I
03:29:38.640 personally believe that the principles
03:29:40.560 of equality equality and fairness demand
03:29:42.960 this
03:29:43.859 I say that as those are rational
03:29:46.020 principles but I also say that as a
03:29:49.020 human being with the emotional makeup
03:29:50.880 that that entails as a human being I
03:29:53.819 close my eyes and imagine
03:29:56.520 if I lived in a world
03:29:58.739 what where what I deeply feel and who I
03:30:01.979 love or how to be fundamentally wrong
03:30:04.739 by many or most of my fellow human
03:30:06.720 beings
03:30:07.680 are at odds with the social mores I see
03:30:09.960 everywhere around me
03:30:11.760 reflected in the media culture education
03:30:14.520 religion I imagine being in that place
03:30:18.479 the pain that comes from that sharp
03:30:20.580 disconnect
03:30:21.720 between the inner life and the outer
03:30:23.880 reality cannot be described in words
03:30:25.620 easily that inequality needs to be
03:30:28.020 addressed
03:30:29.880 so I would like to move on now to the
03:30:31.800 Amendment of the Constitution
03:30:33.600 so this amendment to the Constitution
03:30:35.160 which has been tabled today holds that
03:30:37.560 Parliament has the right to decide on
03:30:40.380 the definition of marriage I see no
03:30:42.479 reason to disagree with this on a matter
03:30:44.880 such as the definition of marriage which
03:30:46.439 is deeply cultural law should be made
03:30:48.960 democratically by the people of
03:30:50.160 Singapore whose voice Parliament
03:30:51.720 reflects such laws should be made by the
03:30:54.060 legislature which is accountable to the
03:30:55.739 people directly and not by the courts
03:30:57.840 which have no such direct accountability
03:31:00.660 so the workers party chair MP Sylvia Lim
03:31:03.300 has made some important arguments about
03:31:05.040 why this amendment is unsatisfactory in
03:31:07.560 a sense redundant and sets a bad
03:31:09.479 precedent I agree with the points she
03:31:11.580 has made which come from a good lawyer's
03:31:13.560 understanding of constitutional law and
03:31:16.080 I say this as a non-lawyer
03:31:17.880 nevertheless as a legislator I believe
03:31:20.399 that the amendment does signify a
03:31:22.560 correct principle one I agree with and I
03:31:25.560 believe that it is a useful signifier to
03:31:27.720 establish however imperfect the
03:31:30.239 mechanism and wording of it may be
03:31:32.700 on grounds of legal scholarship so I
03:31:35.160 support it on that basis
03:31:37.739 Mr Speaker sir in conclusion where do we
03:31:40.920 go from here how can we move forward as
03:31:43.620 one United people as a Democratic
03:31:46.020 Society surely the answer to that
03:31:48.239 question is to cultivate the ability for
03:31:50.819 singaporeans to talk to each other
03:31:52.319 respectfully and rationally to decide an
03:31:55.080 important matters that way
03:31:56.819 to decide our politics that way to
03:31:59.279 decide on laws that way to agree to
03:32:01.500 disagree that way
03:32:03.239 when perfect consensus cannot be forged
03:32:06.000 as it cannot on a range of issues not
03:32:08.520 only 377a
03:32:10.800 for example in this house we debated the
03:32:12.540 issue of hiking GST versus alternative
03:32:14.399 Revenue raising mechanisms that the
03:32:16.680 Workers Party put forward we did not
03:32:18.600 find consensus but there were all but
03:32:20.819 there were points of agreement but in
03:32:22.859 the GST debate the debate turned a
03:32:24.779 rational argument and ultimately
03:32:26.160 philosophic considerations of a secular
03:32:28.319 nature
03:32:29.520 here the debate comes down to matters of
03:32:31.380 deep personal conviction that are less
03:32:33.180 easily resolved with reference to agreed
03:32:35.220 facts
03:32:36.600 will we succeed in cultivating the
03:32:39.359 ability to respectfully disagree on such
03:32:41.520 matters where much of the rest of the
03:32:43.560 world has failed will we succeed in
03:32:46.680 preserving our unity and not allowing
03:32:48.899 these disagreements that are so hard to
03:32:50.520 resolve by debate to become political
03:32:52.500 Rifts
03:32:54.720 sir
03:32:56.279 we will not
03:32:58.080 not completely and not by making
03:33:00.840 straight line progress these views are
03:33:03.660 very deeply rooted and passionate on
03:33:05.520 both sides
03:33:06.779 but can we succeed in moving the needle
03:33:09.180 towards this ideal so that more and more
03:33:11.880 and more of our national discourse
03:33:13.319 gradually becomes like this not in a
03:33:16.020 straight line maybe a zigzag messy line
03:33:18.899 but moving more and more towards a
03:33:21.000 dominant Paradigm that says that we can
03:33:22.979 respectfully agree to disagree and
03:33:25.979 tomorrow we will still be fellow
03:33:28.080 singaporeans still be brothers and
03:33:30.120 sisters still defend the political
03:33:32.040 Center and push those spewing hatred
03:33:34.319 bigotry and violence to the fringes
03:33:37.080 can we hold different views that may
03:33:39.180 never be reconciled and have those views
03:33:41.520 respectfully played out in civil
03:33:43.439 discourse bearing in mind the place of
03:33:46.380 our laws and the place of freedom of
03:33:49.200 speech and religion in a healthy balance
03:33:51.540 bearing in mind that we are all citizens
03:33:54.720 equal before the law can we move forward
03:33:57.600 by respectfully agreeing to disagree
03:33:59.580 without demonizing the one we disagree
03:34:01.979 with but embracing him and hers our
03:34:04.800 fellow citizen our colleague our brother
03:34:06.779 and our sister
03:34:07.920 can we do this sir I think we must
03:34:10.800 I don't know for a fact that we can or
03:34:13.620 will
03:34:14.520 but I do know this
03:34:16.200 from my discussions I've had with my
03:34:18.120 Workers Party colleagues who have
03:34:19.439 expressed or will Express different
03:34:20.939 views from mine in Parliament today on
03:34:22.680 377a I would like to say that I am
03:34:25.859 optimistic that Singapore can do it why
03:34:30.000 because my colleagues and I strive
03:34:32.100 together a Democratic Society
03:34:35.160 we work alongside each other and on this
03:34:38.100 issue we debated discussed learn from
03:34:42.359 one another agreed to disagree with
03:34:45.239 respect and humility and affection
03:34:48.479 and we decided democratically
03:34:51.060 thank you
03:35:03.540 so in 20
03:35:05.160 07 when nominator MP Mr silukam Hong
03:35:07.979 petitioned to repeal section 377a of the
03:35:10.560 penal code I spoke to support the
03:35:12.779 government's position of retaining
03:35:14.460 section 377a
03:35:16.500 I argue that Parliament should make laws
03:35:18.899 to reflect the public morality of our
03:35:21.600 times the messaging by the government is
03:35:24.180 important the Singapore is a society
03:35:26.700 whereby the family unit is still seen as
03:35:29.819 a basic structure of society
03:35:32.220 further the government had indicated
03:35:34.200 that there will not be proactive
03:35:36.779 enforcement of those who are gays at the
03:35:40.200 time PM Lee had said that the government
03:35:42.300 has decided to keep the status quo
03:35:44.760 despite the legal antidiness and the
03:35:47.640 ambiguity PM Lee said it works do not
03:35:51.540 disturb it it works do not disturb it
03:35:54.840 just 15 years later when PM Lee made his
03:35:57.300 announcement during the national day
03:35:59.340 rally in August that the government
03:36:01.140 intends to repeal section 37 a of the
03:36:03.660 penal code I was taken aback what is
03:36:07.260 intended signal by the government when
03:36:09.000 it announced its intention to repeal
03:36:10.920 this law
03:36:11.880 how do we explain to the many
03:36:13.859 singaporeans who are still pro-family
03:36:16.140 and worried about the potential decline
03:36:18.359 in Family Values
03:36:20.220 I spoke to many singaporeans who
03:36:21.960 expressed their concern about the repeal
03:36:23.700 many of them said they do not wish to
03:36:27.300 see homosexuals being prosecuted as
03:36:29.340 criminals but yet yet they are concerned
03:36:32.640 whether the repeal will lead to an
03:36:34.439 erosion of family values an increased
03:36:37.080 number of gay people and I believe many
03:36:39.660 MPS in this house have received letters
03:36:42.180 from concerned residents who Express
03:36:44.100 similar concerns
03:36:47.340 open mind about this issue I also spoke
03:36:50.399 to different groups of citizens who felt
03:36:53.100 that we should allow those who are
03:36:54.840 homosexuals to live a lifestyle that
03:36:57.660 they wish
03:36:58.620 they opined that it is not the
03:37:00.359 government's business to tell our
03:37:01.800 citizens especially those who are gays
03:37:03.899 how to date their lives while some
03:37:06.540 Express concern about the open
03:37:07.859 expression of homosexual relationship
03:37:09.899 like hands holding and public kissing
03:37:12.060 they felt that this that there is no
03:37:15.060 need to make this Behavior a criminal
03:37:17.340 offense hence it appears to the advocacy
03:37:20.160 by the homosexual community over the
03:37:22.200 years has made our citizens more
03:37:24.779 accepting of the gay people
03:37:26.880 they also a number of citizens who felt
03:37:29.340 very neutral about the matter they have
03:37:31.380 no views on the issue at all
03:37:33.359 in other words it is not their concern
03:37:36.600 so in 2007 I said that the majority of
03:37:39.479 singaporeans do not condemn a homosexual
03:37:42.060 or gay simply because of his lifestyle
03:37:44.819 nor do they wish to criminalize a
03:37:47.760 homosexual
03:37:48.960 Minister indrani Raja when she was a
03:37:51.000 back venture had also in Her speech said
03:37:52.800 I think we do not want to have a
03:37:54.840 situation where we demonize homosexuals
03:37:57.359 we certainly do not want to regard them
03:38:00.239 as anything less than singaporeans
03:38:03.540 the government stand at that time was
03:38:05.160 articulated by PM Lee when he said they
03:38:07.800 are gay bars and clubs they exist we
03:38:11.700 know where they are everybody knows
03:38:13.979 where they are they do not have to go
03:38:15.660 underground we do not Harris gays the
03:38:18.840 government does not act as moral
03:38:21.060 policemen and we do not act proactively
03:38:24.120 enforce Section 3 Samsung a on them
03:38:28.020 since the government does not actively
03:38:29.399 enforce Section 3 cents and a on
03:38:31.380 homosexuals the question is whether it
03:38:33.720 is time for Singapore to repeal Section
03:38:36.060 3 sensation a today
03:38:38.580 is the Singapore Society more accepting
03:38:41.040 of homosexuals in our midst
03:38:43.080 will the repeal of section 377a mean
03:38:45.779 that the family is no longer the basic
03:38:48.420 building block of society
03:38:50.880 so the introduction of article 156
03:38:53.279 relating to the institution of marriage
03:38:55.020 has given me great comfort it reinforces
03:38:58.080 the government's stand that the
03:38:59.399 definition of marriage and laws to
03:39:01.680 protect safeguard support Foster and
03:39:05.880 promote the institution of marriage
03:39:07.439 should be for Parliament to decide and
03:39:10.260 that Palace and that parliament's power
03:39:12.180 to make such laws on marriage cannot be
03:39:14.760 challenged under article under part 4 of
03:39:17.100 The Constitution to be discriminatory it
03:39:20.040 gives Assurance to many singaporeans
03:39:21.840 that the repeal of section 377a will not
03:39:25.140 lead to a drastic shift in societal
03:39:27.779 norms
03:39:28.800 so I'm also heartened by the commitment
03:39:30.540 made by PM Lee and DPM Lawrence wants
03:39:33.120 that they will not be any change in the
03:39:35.399 definition of marriage during their
03:39:37.140 watch
03:39:38.580 so after speaking to many singaporeans
03:39:40.439 across a white Spectrum I've concluded
03:39:43.020 that it is time to repeal section 37a
03:39:47.760 many singaporeans have accepted that
03:39:49.680 homosexuals are fellow singaporeans
03:39:51.899 living in our midst and doing their part
03:39:54.479 to contribute to Singapore
03:39:56.899 Norms have changed over the years
03:39:59.640 in particular many of the younger
03:40:02.279 generation are accepting of the
03:40:04.020 homosexual people
03:40:05.460 and similar to the position of many
03:40:06.960 singaporeans which I alluded to 15 years
03:40:10.020 ago we do not wish to see homosexuals
03:40:12.899 being criminalized
03:40:17.760 for many singaporeans is that we need to
03:40:20.700 protect marriage as a union between men
03:40:23.520 and women that we need to support values
03:40:26.399 that promote the role of the family as a
03:40:28.859 basic building block of society
03:40:30.899 that we need to protect singaporeans
03:40:32.640 from being intimidated or harassed
03:40:34.920 simply because they disagree with the
03:40:38.220 lifestyle of the gay community
03:40:40.319 many within the religious community are
03:40:42.479 also concerned whether the repeal of
03:40:44.279 section 377a will lead to a situation
03:40:46.939 whereby the religious leaders cannot
03:40:49.800 tell their congregation that they do not
03:40:51.899 agree with the practice of homosexuality
03:40:54.300 the religious leaders are concerned that
03:40:56.760 they cannot pray for someone who is
03:40:58.560 homosexual to reflect on God's command
03:41:01.260 in other words the religious leaders
03:41:03.899 lose their freedom to preach on what is
03:41:06.540 acceptable or wrong based on their faith
03:41:09.540 and that's their concern so there are
03:41:12.000 also many who could express concern
03:41:13.680 about intolerant views of some gays who
03:41:16.260 attack anyone who disagree with their
03:41:18.779 homosexual views
03:41:20.399 their fears about the activism of some
03:41:22.500 of the LGBT community who push their
03:41:24.899 ideology that their worldview should be
03:41:27.600 seen as a norm and acceptable therefore
03:41:30.660 anyone who disagrees with their
03:41:32.700 worldview should be condemned and
03:41:34.800 ostracized
03:41:36.239 in Australia when the government held a
03:41:38.220 poster poll on the same-sex marriage it
03:41:40.560 resulted in vitriolic abuse against
03:41:43.260 people holding views in opposition to
03:41:46.020 the legalization of same-sex marriage an
03:41:49.080 Australian politician said
03:41:51.180 a culture has developed whereby it is
03:41:54.000 acceptable to vilify mock abuse and
03:41:57.779 shame anyone who stands in a way or even
03:42:00.540 raises questions about whether we should
03:42:02.220 legalize same-sex marriage I've been
03:42:05.040 called a homophobe a bigger I have been
03:42:07.680 told that My Views are disgusting so set
03:42:11.279 the Australian politician and when such
03:42:13.859 strong and intimidating language is used
03:42:16.260 it is impossible to hold a civil debate
03:42:19.200 or respectful discussion about any topic
03:42:21.960 regarding the gay community
03:42:25.020 so I met with the organizers of the
03:42:26.880 protect Singapore Town Hall they told me
03:42:29.279 that their town hall meeting was almost
03:42:31.140 canceled because of complaints and
03:42:33.300 threats by the gay community
03:42:35.520 so they complained that the minority in
03:42:38.160 the gay movement are refusing to allow
03:42:40.380 anyone to have a conversation about
03:42:42.540 their concerns regarding homosexuality
03:42:45.840 so I think this is sad because many
03:42:47.819 homosexuals that I know are very decent
03:42:50.340 people and I have deep respect for such
03:42:52.319 people because their sexual preference
03:42:55.140 is really not an issue to me
03:42:58.080 but because of this small minority of
03:43:00.840 militant homosexuals they give the
03:43:03.660 others a Bad Name by being bullies and
03:43:06.060 by being difficult in their conduct
03:43:08.279 so I've also received feedback that
03:43:09.840 employees in international organizations
03:43:11.880 or mncs located within Singapore they
03:43:14.819 are Harris in their workplace if they do
03:43:16.500 not support the gay beliefs or if they
03:43:18.660 refuse to attend a bright event thus it
03:43:22.020 seems that there is a reversal of role
03:43:24.120 it's not the gays who are being
03:43:25.979 discriminated in Singapore on the
03:43:28.080 contrary if you do not agree with the
03:43:30.180 pro-game movement you may be penalized
03:43:32.700 at work or face discrimination and
03:43:35.220 likewise for students studying in
03:43:36.840 international schools they are asked to
03:43:39.000 take part in gay team projects as if it
03:43:41.700 was part and parcel of the school
03:43:43.859 curriculum
03:43:45.300 so I urge the government to look into
03:43:46.800 this to ensure that no organization
03:43:49.279 company or School in Singapore can
03:43:52.380 compel their staff or students to
03:43:55.260 participate in gay community projects if
03:43:58.380 they do not subscribe to the same values
03:44:01.439 I submit that every organization company
03:44:03.960 or School must have the scope to allow
03:44:06.479 their employees or students to subscribe
03:44:09.000 to different views on sexuality without
03:44:11.640 being discriminated or having to receive
03:44:14.340 hate mail
03:44:16.080 I also urged the government to consider
03:44:17.819 legislation to make it an offense for
03:44:20.580 anyone to put out hit messages or
03:44:23.220 derogatory comments just purely to
03:44:26.220 intimidate others into keeping silent
03:44:28.260 and this law should apply equally to
03:44:30.420 those who are anti-gay and those gays
03:44:33.000 who seek to bully others into silent
03:44:35.700 submission
03:44:36.960 so there should be no space for
03:44:38.700 Singapore for people to propagate hate
03:44:40.680 messages within Singapore let me say
03:44:43.140 that again there should be no space for
03:44:45.180 people to propagate hate messages within
03:44:48.180 Singapore
03:44:49.920 even as we move to repeal section 37 a I
03:44:53.760 hope the government will also make it
03:44:55.319 make clear its stand that our policies
03:44:57.540 on sexuality education in schools our
03:45:00.180 content guidelines for Publications for
03:45:02.819 video games and various type of media
03:45:04.979 will remain Pro family they will not
03:45:08.460 that we will not see a proliferation of
03:45:10.920 materials video games or media
03:45:13.560 advertisements promoting the gay
03:45:15.479 lifestyle that we will not have laws
03:45:17.760 that allow individuals to remove their
03:45:19.380 gender in their nric or passport
03:45:22.200 and that the government will remind all
03:45:24.300 organizations companies and even
03:45:26.460 embassies operating in Singapore that we
03:45:29.399 are still a society that values family
03:45:31.920 as a building block of society so I
03:45:35.160 support the repeal of section 37a of the
03:45:37.260 penal code and the amendment to the
03:45:39.660 Constitution to insert article 156 to
03:45:42.479 the Constitution thank you
03:45:45.420 order I propose to take a break now
03:45:48.060 suspended sitting I will take the chair
03:45:49.800 at 4 55 PM order order
03:46:14.340 foreign
04:11:09.120 foreign
04:11:16.260 foreign
04:11:23.699 of debate on the constitution of the
04:11:26.279 Republic of Singapore amendment number
04:11:27.960 three Bill second reading Mr Gerald game
04:11:38.520 Mr Deputy speaker
04:11:40.319 the government has decided to repeal
04:11:42.300 section 377a of the penal code
04:11:45.180 since these plans were first revealed
04:11:47.220 many alginate GRC residents have reached
04:11:49.859 out to me to express their views about
04:11:51.660 this issue
04:11:53.040 residents spoke to me during my house to
04:11:55.080 house visits came to my meet the people
04:11:57.120 sessions sent me WhatsApp messages
04:11:59.120 emails and petitions and wrote detailed
04:12:02.399 letters explaining their arguments
04:12:05.100 several invited me to their homes where
04:12:07.380 they gathered their friends and family
04:12:09.239 to passionately Express their concerns
04:12:12.000 and urged me to raise them in Parliament
04:12:14.880 these included representations from
04:12:16.859 members of the LGBT community who see
04:12:19.560 section 377a as a law that discriminates
04:12:22.739 against them and victimizes them and
04:12:25.260 whose support is repeal
04:12:27.000 I acknowledge these sentiments as they
04:12:29.040 cut to the core of whole members of the
04:12:31.080 LGBT community see themselves
04:12:33.720 my constituents feedback can be grouped
04:12:36.060 into several sometimes overlapping
04:12:37.979 categories
04:12:39.239 first there are concerns that the repeal
04:12:41.640 of section 377a will remove an important
04:12:44.760 societal marker and open the door to an
04:12:47.640 erosion of Traditional Values in our
04:12:49.439 society
04:12:50.880 second some are worried that after this
04:12:53.160 law is repealed there will be a domino
04:12:55.260 effect on other regulations and policies
04:12:57.660 leading towards the normalization of
04:12:59.819 homosexuality in our society from
04:13:02.279 changes to sexuality education in
04:13:04.140 schools to more liberal media portrayals
04:13:06.540 and eventually the legalization of
04:13:08.699 same-sex marriage
04:13:10.620 third many especially those from the
04:13:13.319 younger age groups are concerned that as
04:13:15.899 the societal narrative shifts they will
04:13:18.239 find it harder to freely Express their
04:13:20.220 own beliefs without being labeled as
04:13:22.260 homophobic they worry about getting
04:13:24.600 canceled or suffering discrimination in
04:13:27.060 school or at the workplace because of
04:13:29.220 their beliefs
04:13:31.080 fourth some have expressed concerns that
04:13:33.899 the higher health risks of some types of
04:13:36.359 sexual practices are not being
04:13:38.100 adequately communicated to young people
04:13:39.960 for fear of being sound of sounding
04:13:42.000 discriminatory
04:13:43.800 fifth others are worried that the
04:13:45.899 disruption to the current equilibrium
04:13:47.880 will lead to an increase in advocacy by
04:13:50.460 groups on both sides and Spark the type
04:13:52.800 of cultural Wars seen in other nations
04:13:54.600 which will present challenges to
04:13:56.640 Singapore's National cohesion
04:13:59.040 sixth some have argued that the LGBT
04:14:01.739 community is already disadvantaged by
04:14:04.140 the laws that support the
04:14:05.279 heteronormative family and that
04:14:07.319 repealing section 377a does not confer
04:14:10.319 any tangible disadvantages on those who
04:14:12.479 oppose the change these residents of the
04:14:15.060 view that section 377a should be
04:14:17.279 repealed
04:14:18.540 7th residents on both sides of the
04:14:21.300 debate have cited the Need To Live and
04:14:23.399 Let Live and call for greater tolerance
04:14:25.739 of different views
04:14:27.899 these are diverse and often opposing
04:14:30.300 positions on what is clearly a very
04:14:32.880 controversial issue
04:14:34.859 those that one of the one end of the
04:14:36.600 spectrum rule the data this Market is
04:14:38.760 removed while those on the other see it
04:14:41.340 as one of the many social changes they
04:14:43.080 wish to see in our country
04:14:45.000 I've also noticed a large Middle Ground
04:14:47.760 which does not have strong opinions on
04:14:49.920 this issue and is more concerned about
04:14:52.020 bread and butter issues
04:14:55.020 there is in fact some agreement on both
04:14:57.180 sides of the Divide both agree that
04:14:59.580 section 377a Bears significant symbolic
04:15:02.640 weight in our society
04:15:04.500 they both also anticipate that the
04:15:06.359 repeal of section 377a will open the
04:15:08.939 door to many more challenges to the
04:15:11.160 prevailing Norms in our society
04:15:13.800 these are all valid concerns and sincere
04:15:16.560 feedback expressed by singaporeans all
04:15:19.380 of whom have the interest of our nation
04:15:21.180 at heart
04:15:22.500 they included young middle aged and
04:15:25.140 older singaporeans
04:15:26.939 listening to constituents on both sides
04:15:29.100 of this contentious debate presented
04:15:31.199 challenges for me on how to raise them
04:15:33.420 both in this house
04:15:34.979 I see it as my responsibility as a
04:15:37.140 member of parliament to reflect the
04:15:39.000 feedback and concerns of my constituents
04:15:40.979 in this house
04:15:42.120 however as an elected representative I
04:15:45.180 will also need to take a stand and vote
04:15:47.100 on these bills
04:15:48.720 my vote will be based first and foremost
04:15:51.540 on what I believe is in the best
04:15:53.760 long-term interest of our nation
04:15:56.160 this will take into account this will
04:15:58.380 take into consideration the viewpoints
04:16:00.300 of my constituents and my own conscience
04:16:03.180 Mr Deputy speaker it is my sincere
04:16:05.880 belief that retaining section 377a
04:16:08.520 without enforcing it provides the best
04:16:10.680 balance of the conflicting interests in
04:16:12.660 our society
04:16:14.220 I've come to agree with the prime
04:16:15.779 minister with what the Prime Minister
04:16:17.220 said in Parliament on 23rd October 2007
04:16:19.920 when he explained that the government
04:16:21.779 was retaining section 377a but not
04:16:25.080 proactively enforcing it
04:16:27.479 this was to quote the court of appeal a
04:16:30.300 political compromise that would that was
04:16:32.520 conceived with the express intention of
04:16:34.319 accommodating Divergent interests
04:16:36.540 avoiding polarization and facilitating
04:16:39.260 incremental change
04:16:42.300 attorney general Lucian Wong took
04:16:44.399 further steps in 2018 by noting that the
04:16:47.040 police will not proactively enforce
04:16:48.840 section 377-a for instance by conducting
04:16:51.779 enforcement rates
04:16:53.520 he added that the public prosecutor has
04:16:55.739 taken the position that prosecution of
04:16:58.020 two consenting adults in a private space
04:17:00.300 in a private place under secretary
04:17:02.460 section 377a absent other factors would
04:17:06.120 not be in the public interest
04:17:08.460 this assurance was strengthened when the
04:17:10.800 court of appeal ruled in February 2022
04:17:13.199 that section 377a is unenfossible in its
04:17:17.040 entirety unless and until the public
04:17:19.560 prosecutor of the day provides clear
04:17:21.840 notice that he intends to reassert his
04:17:24.600 right to enforce section 377a
04:17:26.819 proactively by way of prosecution and
04:17:29.880 will no longer abide by the
04:17:31.500 representations made by attorney general
04:17:33.180 Wong in 2018.
04:17:35.819 section 377a is therefore no longer a
04:17:39.779 sort of democles hanging over men in
04:17:42.120 same-sex relationships they will not be
04:17:44.580 prosecuted or convicted under Section
04:17:47.000 377a for consensual sexual acts done in
04:17:50.100 private
04:17:51.000 furthermore section 377a has never
04:17:53.580 criminalized same-sex attraction between
04:17:55.739 men or same-sex relations between women
04:18:00.060 the final reason for the vote I am about
04:18:01.859 to cast is that my conscience does not
04:18:04.560 allow me to vote in favor of a repeal of
04:18:06.840 section 377a
04:18:08.760 I'm grateful to the leader of the
04:18:10.380 opposition for lifting the whip on
04:18:12.000 Workers Party MPS for a vote on this on
04:18:14.460 both these bills this permits what wpmps
04:18:17.460 to cast conscious votes on these bills
04:18:21.180 sir I entered politics almost 14 years
04:18:23.819 ago because I wanted to contribute to
04:18:25.859 the Democratic development of our
04:18:27.359 country and proposed policies that would
04:18:29.699 improve the welfare of our people
04:18:31.859 it is important to me and the example
04:18:34.319 that I set for my children that I hold
04:18:36.600 faster the values that I've established
04:18:38.279 to be true without wavering because of
04:18:41.040 political hitwinds
04:18:42.840 while some especially those in the LGBT
04:18:45.300 community and many of my friends
04:18:47.300 residents party members and volunteers
04:18:50.040 may strongly disagree with my position I
04:18:53.340 hope that they will accept that these
04:18:55.140 are my sincerely held values which I'm
04:18:57.359 trying my best to uphold
04:18:59.880 my vote is not an attack on their values
04:19:02.640 nor a diminishing of their Humanity in
04:19:05.520 any way
04:19:07.319 some have criticized me for allowing my
04:19:09.239 faith to inform my vote in Parliament
04:19:10.920 arguing that the two should be kept
04:19:12.960 separate
04:19:13.920 however what one member informed by
04:19:16.920 their faith and conscience believed to
04:19:18.779 be in the best interest of the country
04:19:20.100 in some issues May differ from what
04:19:22.739 another member believes
04:19:24.479 this issue is certainly one of them
04:19:27.660 I have been told in my face by a
04:19:29.520 constituent that he will not vote for me
04:19:31.739 in the future because of my stand on
04:19:33.660 this issue
04:19:35.040 I accept the importance that many
04:19:37.199 singaporeans place on the elected MPS
04:19:39.180 positions on these bills to the extent
04:19:41.640 that it would be a factor in their
04:19:43.560 decisions at the polls
04:19:45.300 however I hope singaporeans will
04:19:47.699 consider the broader issues at hand
04:19:49.979 there are too many important issues that
04:19:52.380 affect the lives of singaporeans for
04:19:54.359 one's vote to be decided based on this
04:19:56.580 single issue
04:19:59.100 Mr Deputy speaker
04:20:00.779 this has been one of the most difficult
04:20:02.640 speeches to prepare
04:20:04.560 I was worried I may come across as
04:20:06.239 prejudiced against members of the LGBT
04:20:08.520 community
04:20:09.660 hand on heart I'm not
04:20:12.300 LGBT persons are are human beings worthy
04:20:16.920 of the same amount of love and respect
04:20:18.479 that we occur to any other person
04:20:21.420 many of our family members friends
04:20:23.640 colleagues and fellow singaporeans
04:20:27.060 disagreeing with LGBT positions is not
04:20:29.819 an attack on LGBT persons in fact I hope
04:20:33.960 that my speech will open up a platform
04:20:35.819 for more difficult but respectful
04:20:38.340 conversations on this issue
04:20:41.460 however we must recognize that LGBT
04:20:44.460 issues are sensitive issues just like
04:20:47.460 race and religion
04:20:49.500 people who subscribe to one phase do not
04:20:52.080 force their beliefs on others
04:20:53.880 religious beliefs are also not taught as
04:20:56.160 facts in our school curriculum that
04:20:58.500 students are expected to accept without
04:21:00.180 question
04:21:01.680 similarly we should treat LGBT issues as
04:21:04.620 sensitive topics just like religion
04:21:07.080 we should not force people to accept one
04:21:09.120 view or another
04:21:11.399 with the risk of being labeled as
04:21:12.840 bigoted or immoral
04:21:15.180 this is not to say that the issue should
04:21:16.739 not be discussed at all
04:21:18.479 on the contrary discussion should be
04:21:21.060 encouraged but as a balanced discussion
04:21:23.340 on different viewpoints not as a lesson
04:21:26.279 on facts
04:21:28.800 it is inherent in a society as diverse
04:21:31.260 as Singapore's that there will be
04:21:33.180 fundamental differences in values and
04:21:35.580 World Views among our people
04:21:37.680 this need not be a source of conflict
04:21:40.859 while we may disagree on some issues
04:21:42.720 there are so many other issues that we
04:21:45.120 agree on and can work together to
04:21:47.100 advance
04:21:48.300 we do not need to descend into labeling
04:21:50.460 name calling or questioning the word of
04:21:52.920 our fellow human beings
04:21:54.600 instead we need to open up spaces for
04:21:57.180 our people to hold different views at
04:21:59.279 work in schools and even within families
04:22:03.120 by looking beyond our differences in
04:22:05.520 working together on what we have in
04:22:07.920 common we will build that better Society
04:22:10.680 we all Aspire towards Mr Deputy speaker
04:22:13.859 I will vote against the penal code
04:22:15.779 Amendment Bill and vote for the
04:22:18.120 Constitutional Amendment bill

04:23:20.880 these examples do not mean any direct
04:23:23.580 correlation between the sexual
04:23:25.319 orientation and their talent or
04:23:27.239 achievements there are many people who
04:23:30.060 just happened to be gay who have made
04:23:32.640 contributions to the society in their
04:23:35.399 own way
04:23:36.540 whether in the professional whether in
04:23:39.239 the profession or just as individuals
04:23:42.359 these are people who walk among us every
04:23:44.880 day they are our friends
04:23:47.100 our family members all colleagues and
04:23:50.160 our peers
04:23:51.420 they should not be treated any lesser
04:23:53.939 for what they would like to do in
04:23:56.640 private
04:23:58.199 we need to be inclusive of different
04:24:00.120 Lifestyles just as we like to have the
04:24:02.220 choice and freedom to lead our private
04:24:05.100 life in peace
04:24:07.680 the repeal of section 377a is the right
04:24:10.859 thing to do
04:24:11.939 if we are to ensure that Singapore is an
04:24:14.699 inclusive and diverse place to live in
04:24:16.800 and for everyone to be part of
04:24:20.939 I spoke in 2007 in support of a repeal
04:24:24.779 that was 23 years after the last review
04:24:28.140 of the penal code
04:24:30.899 I said then that I hope we wouldn't take
04:24:34.080 another 23 years to address this again
04:24:37.620 I'm glad that our government
04:24:40.800 made this decision today
04:24:44.520 over the last 15 years public sentiment
04:24:47.100 has evolved there is a shift away from
04:24:50.640 our previous views especially more
04:24:53.699 evident among the Young
04:24:55.620 they feel there is Injustice
04:24:58.620 that there are penalties targeted
04:25:00.960 specifically
04:25:02.819 at section X between men
04:25:06.779 on the reinforcement of the institutions
04:25:08.819 of marriage by the amendment in the
04:25:10.680 Constitution I welcome it
04:25:12.960 its sickness The pro-family Stance of
04:25:16.380 the current government and population
04:25:19.560 it is also the right thing to allow the
04:25:22.560 definition of marriage to continue be
04:25:24.899 covered by the woman's Charter
04:25:27.060 if and when the majority of our
04:25:29.880 population or Parliament feels that the
04:25:32.520 current definition needs to change
04:25:34.920 that should be for our future generation
04:25:37.620 to decide
04:25:39.600 it is important that the provisions and
04:25:42.720 any amendments
04:25:44.279 in the Constitution
04:25:45.250 [Music]
04:25:48.500 otherwise it loses its value to

04:31:25.739 people's views and social norms do
04:31:28.560 change over time
04:31:30.239 in the past it was unusual for men to
04:31:33.300 wear earrings remove body hair or perm
04:31:36.359 the hair for women to wear skirts that
04:31:38.819 do not extend below their knees or for
04:31:41.100 anyone except gangsters to have tattoos
04:31:44.340 now we see these expressions of
04:31:46.500 individuality frequently in our everyday
04:31:49.199 lives
04:31:50.580 we should not tie our future Generations
04:31:54.960 to be restricted
04:31:56.640 by today's traditions and Norms instead
04:32:00.540 we should advocate for more freedom to
04:32:03.659 for them to decide how they want to live
04:32:07.260 their lives
04:32:08.699 it is difficult to predict how society
04:32:11.159 would change in the future and how our
04:32:13.680 children and grandchildren
04:32:15.720 decide to govern themselves then
04:32:18.060 it's important that members of
04:32:20.220 Singapore's lgbtq plus Community are not
04:32:23.819 discriminated for choosing how they want
04:32:26.819 to live their lives and for who they
04:32:29.760 love
04:32:30.720 nevertheless changes in public
04:32:33.359 perception will take place take time and
04:32:36.359 we will act accordingly if and when
04:32:38.819 these sentiments are right
04:32:41.939 today
04:32:43.199 we are addressing an act of intimacy in
04:32:46.620 this case for men with men
04:32:49.199 just like any other kind of relationship
04:32:51.479 let us continue to maintain expression
04:32:54.899 in the public display of affections
04:32:58.380 therefore evocacy of specific rights
04:33:01.560 before our society is really I mean do
04:33:05.879 more harm than good
04:33:08.820 we aim to be more Progressive but we
04:33:12.061 must ensure that our Direction and steps
04:33:15.480 are carefully considered
04:33:18.359 today we are taking a step towards a
04:33:22.320 more tolerant and inclusive Singapore we
04:33:25.799 are debating on the issue of the freedom
04:33:28.919 to love
04:33:31.259 let us continue to keep the love for
04:33:34.141 everyone in Singapore's Society
04:33:37.379 I support the repeal of section 377a and
04:33:41.699 the Amendment of the Constitution to
04:33:43.919 protect the prevailing definition of
04:33:46.799 marriage thank you
04:33:49.020 Mr Alexia
04:33:55.199 Mr Speaker sir this is a debate that I
04:33:58.020 have taught long and hard about it's an
04:34:00.180 issue close to my heart and also to many
04:34:02.458 conservative singaporeans at Large
04:34:05.660 377a has been a key flash point of
04:34:08.340 debate on societal Norms Traditional
04:34:11.278 Values Freedom equality and many other
04:34:13.680 topics
04:34:14.759 this very house has also seen many a
04:34:16.799 fiery and passionate debate over the
04:34:19.259 last two decades on this issue
04:34:21.539 in our courts it has witnessed a share
04:34:24.299 of constitutional challenges as no other
04:34:26.458 law perhaps has seen
04:34:29.099 and it is with the most recent challenge
04:34:31.080 in the courts that has brought us here
04:34:33.118 today
04:34:34.438 for many section 377a represents a
04:34:37.680 bulwark against a perceived
04:34:39.539 counter-cultural tide that may engulf
04:34:42.118 Society should the law be done away
04:34:45.118 this has held true for many years
04:34:47.641 in particular the last 15 following the
04:34:50.520 political compromise of 2007. but it was
04:34:54.480 an uneasy compromise as each
04:34:56.699 constitutional challenge risked it being
04:34:59.039 struck down by the courts rather than
04:35:01.680 legislated by Parliament
04:35:03.599 by not proactively enforcing 377a also
04:35:07.320 in essence made it redundant as a law
04:35:10.680 at this point it's worth noting that for
04:35:13.080 most conservatives opposition to the
04:35:15.061 repeal of 377a is premised not only act
04:35:17.879 nor the actors itself but what the
04:35:21.000 repeal may lead to
04:35:23.039 what I alluded to earlier of that tide a
04:35:26.938 slippery slope of what they view as
04:35:29.219 same-sex unions adoptions and surrogacy
04:35:31.561 by same-sex couples becoming the norm
04:35:34.618 recent interviews with Apex religious
04:35:36.958 leaders in the media show that it
04:35:39.240 remains a complex issue however they do
04:35:42.240 acknowledge that the prerogative of
04:35:44.340 repeal lies with Parliament
04:35:47.580 as long as the rights of the religious
04:35:50.278 are protected in what they believe in
04:35:52.500 and what they can preach
04:35:54.480 as a parliamentarian my public duty is
04:35:57.778 to make laws that are for all
04:35:59.580 singaporeans
04:36:00.900 but I'm not just a legislator as other
04:36:04.259 members have mentioned we are Guided by
04:36:06.539 our culture our faith and who and our
04:36:09.840 environment that we grow up in
04:36:11.879 I'm a Catholic by faith Guided by the
04:36:14.340 teachings of my faith to discern with
04:36:15.900 Justice decisions that are moral I'm
04:36:18.539 also a father and a husband whose moral
04:36:20.879 duty it is to ensure stability and the
04:36:23.160 well-being for my children and family
04:36:25.438 so I arrive at today's debate having
04:36:27.299 wrestled with all my roles and
04:36:29.160 responsibilities
04:36:30.660 I also arrive having had the opportunity
04:36:33.061 over the last few months to have robust
04:36:36.000 intense and passionate discussions with
04:36:38.699 fellow legislators on this topic and
04:36:41.219 many constituents and singaporeans who
04:36:43.859 have corresponded with me and feel
04:36:46.141 passionately about this issue on both
04:36:49.080 sides
04:36:50.160 I'm deeply appreciative of the
04:36:52.020 willingness of all sides of the debate
04:36:53.820 to have listened rationally and
04:36:56.099 respectfully to each other to arrive at
04:36:58.561 common ground
04:37:00.359 Mr Deputy speaker let me first speak on
04:37:02.759 the Constitutional Amendment and I will
04:37:05.099 state what I believe marriage to be
04:37:07.680 marriage is a bond that draws man and
04:37:10.020 woman together it's a natural
04:37:11.699 relationship frame not just by love but
04:37:14.278 Promises of commitment and
04:37:16.020 responsibility
04:37:17.340 marriage aligns with the way in which
04:37:19.618 men and women live
04:37:21.561 interdependently and bring out the best
04:37:23.520 in each other
04:37:24.660 marriage is also a fateful exclusive
04:37:27.118 lifelong Union of a man and a woman
04:37:29.039 joined in an intimate community
04:37:31.980 it is the Bedrock of families and
04:37:34.020 conversely society as well
04:37:36.958 a man and woman commit themselves to
04:37:39.061 each other for better for worse
04:37:41.278 to the wondrous responsibility of
04:37:43.919 bringing children into the world caring
04:37:46.259 for them
04:37:48.480 though call to marriage is also woven
04:37:50.879 deeply into how Society Works into the
04:37:54.118 human Spirit itself
04:37:55.740 man and woman of course are equal
04:37:58.320 but however are created differently but
04:38:01.141 made for each other
04:38:03.359 this sexual difference draws them
04:38:05.219 together in a mutually loving Union that
04:38:07.740 should always be open to family
04:38:10.740 therefore erasing the connection between
04:38:12.778 gender and marriage changes the
04:38:14.938 fundamental nature of a marital Union
04:38:17.699 which is to nurture society's Next
04:38:19.980 Generation
04:38:21.359 unlike other relationships marriage has
04:38:23.580 the potential to create and nurture new
04:38:25.438 lives and making it a unique Institution
04:38:28.618 for this reason states recognize the
04:38:31.680 marriage of a man and woman as a public
04:38:33.419 institution in its laws marriage is
04:38:36.240 protected and honored because it makes
04:38:38.340 an exclusive and indispensable influence
04:38:40.919 over the common good of society
04:38:43.799 the real problem today
04:38:45.778 is a view that marriage is simply a
04:38:48.539 formality or fact with no social
04:38:51.359 obligations that is just a private and
04:38:55.020 personal decision between two persons
04:38:57.539 with nothing to do with wider Society
04:39:00.539 but marriage is not just a religious or
04:39:03.118 cultural institution it is a legal
04:39:05.699 institution as well in a heterosexual
04:39:08.278 marriage by bringing children into
04:39:09.958 society the state has an obligation
04:39:12.660 towards the couple and their children
04:39:15.359 for this reason marriage requires the
04:39:17.641 state to intervene and regulate it
04:39:19.919 because of the social implications
04:39:22.438 if it's just a relationship between two
04:39:24.480 Ordinary People we don't regulate
04:39:26.278 ordinary friendship or even platonic
04:39:28.561 friendships Mr Deputy speaker
04:39:31.500 in preparing for this debate I was
04:39:33.660 cautioned by quite a number of people
04:39:35.879 that to speak against redefinition of
04:39:38.040 marriage signifies perhaps a failure to
04:39:40.140 keep up with the times that those of us
04:39:42.540 who hold on to the traditional
04:39:44.340 definition of marriage are conservative
04:39:46.440 in all fashioned out of touch with
04:39:48.840 reality
04:39:51.718 yet earlier this year and Paul did find
04:39:54.120 that the majority of singaporeans oppose
04:39:56.280 same-sex marriage some 66 percent also
04:39:59.280 agreed with a proposal to perhaps
04:40:01.500 consider enshrining marriage as only
04:40:03.600 between a man and a woman
04:40:05.820 those who share these sentiments are
04:40:07.920 called out online and accused of blind
04:40:11.040 Prejudice of being bigots
04:40:13.560 in fact I sat as many members have
04:40:16.020 alluded to that in taking a stand about
04:40:18.180 this I and other members open ourselves
04:40:20.458 to disagreement by others strong
04:40:23.640 disagreement at times
04:40:25.500 I appreciate therefore this opportunity
04:40:27.420 for a respectful debate in this house
04:40:29.160 because in a democracy it is important
04:40:32.340 that the viewpoints of all citizens can
04:40:34.740 be heard and taken into consideration
04:40:38.400 I do support the Constitutional
04:40:40.440 Amendment
04:40:41.340 but as some would be aware I would have
04:40:43.798 preferred to push for heterosexual
04:40:45.718 marriage to be enshrined or codified as
04:40:48.120 a fundamental Liberty in our
04:40:49.500 constitution
04:40:50.700 yet I acknowledge that that same high
04:40:53.160 bar for constitutional amendment in the
04:40:55.320 future would apply to defining marriage
04:40:58.080 in the Constitution right now
04:41:01.140 in as much as the current Amendment
04:41:02.878 would not be considered equivalent to
04:41:04.920 enshrining marriage it offers a clear
04:41:07.620 definition of marriage as it currently
04:41:10.378 stands as a union between a man and a
04:41:13.378 woman
04:41:14.100 I hold the government to its word that
04:41:16.138 under its watch that no redefinition of
04:41:19.378 marriage will take place
04:41:21.000 and even a few even if a future
04:41:23.458 government does so it would perhaps
04:41:25.560 require a repeal of this article 156
04:41:29.280 that we are introducing as it would be
04:41:31.560 made redundant
04:41:33.298 I therefore seek the government's
04:41:34.798 continued affirmation that this remains
04:41:37.200 its commitment
04:41:38.638 and this being the year of celebrating
04:41:40.740 family perhaps all the more apt that we
04:41:43.680 collectively pass this amendment and
04:41:45.840 affirm marriage and the family and their
04:41:48.540 place in our society
04:41:50.700 with the passing of the Constitutional
04:41:52.798 Amendment the task is not complete
04:41:56.160 there is added impetus on multiple
04:41:58.138 fronts the Tasker head will require a
04:42:00.480 whole society effort to emphasize the
04:42:02.940 importance of marriage and the family
04:42:05.540 not just on the part of the government
04:42:07.798 but for every individual and group that
04:42:11.280 believes in the importance of marriage
04:42:13.500 and family and to Champion it
04:42:16.080 collectively
04:42:17.580 our laws that uphold the family and
04:42:19.680 marriage especially on spousal rights
04:42:21.540 must be re-emphasized education the key
04:42:24.718 level of a society that's widely
04:42:26.638 available for all in Singapore must
04:42:29.458 continue to ensure that our curricula
04:42:31.378 continues to uphold the current
04:42:33.900 definition of marriage and family
04:42:36.000 and in the media space print and then
04:42:38.520 broadcast must also help to shape the
04:42:41.520 Norms as currently established
04:42:44.940 Mr speaker now let me touch on the
04:42:47.218 operational aspect of the amendment
04:42:49.620 the amendment as it stands in article
04:42:52.500 156 spells out that the government
04:42:54.600 cannot be challenged in court over the
04:42:56.760 definition of marriage
04:42:58.620 but I hope the government will help to
04:43:00.660 clarify is the protection of
04:43:03.378 non-governmental entities from legal
04:43:06.958 challenges over the issue of marriage in
04:43:09.480 the public sphere
04:43:10.820 rightfully our government is secular and
04:43:14.040 must remain so it does not base its laws
04:43:17.100 or policies on religion or faith
04:43:20.100 but Singapore is also a multi-religious
04:43:22.620 and multi-racial Society
04:43:25.020 we built this city on our Asian values
04:43:27.660 culture and traditions
04:43:29.700 many citizens believe and way of life
04:43:32.340 are shaped in line with their religious
04:43:34.260 and cultural beliefs
04:43:36.120 singaporeans must feel free and safe to
04:43:39.420 practice their beliefs without fear of
04:43:42.180 backlash as long as their own actions do
04:43:45.840 not cause harm or danger to others
04:43:49.138 so what protections are there to ensure
04:43:51.360 that businesses and other institutions
04:43:53.458 such as religious organizations are
04:43:56.160 freed from legal challenges regarding
04:43:58.798 teachings and beliefs on marriage for
04:44:01.860 example if a religious institution
04:44:03.600 declines to conduct a ceremony for
04:44:06.180 transgender or same-sex couple will they
04:44:09.000 be subject to a lawsuit there are many
04:44:11.280 other implications and I hope that the
04:44:14.100 government will be able to clarify this
04:44:17.280 Mr Deputy speaker I now move on to the
04:44:19.860 repeal of section 377a of the penal code
04:44:24.240 this is a decision that I struggled
04:44:26.280 deeply over the last few months
04:44:27.840 personally and professionally
04:44:30.180 I made the point early on the role of
04:44:32.218 section 377a
04:44:34.500 as a book
04:44:36.360 if we do pass article 156 and pass it we
04:44:40.378 must I am of the belief that the new
04:44:42.958 gate perhaps not as robust as what
04:44:47.040 many perceived 377a itself to be but a
04:44:50.520 gate nonetheless will now be in place
04:44:53.218 as I have made clear earlier the
04:44:55.138 non-enforcement of 377a has made the law
04:44:57.900 itself redundant
04:44:59.458 Parliament alone therefore should be
04:45:01.440 responsible for the passing Amendment
04:45:03.298 and repeal of all laws and she states
04:45:05.940 that right clearly today rather than
04:45:08.940 wait for the courts to strike it down
04:45:11.340 as such I am prepared to support the
04:45:14.638 repeal of 377a with the passage of the
04:45:18.420 Constitutional Amendment
04:45:20.218 I must also emphasize that I am not
04:45:22.580 unsympathetic to the experiences of
04:45:24.840 rejection violence and vilification that
04:45:28.138 the lgbtq plus Community faces I know
04:45:31.620 many of them and I'm honored to enjoy
04:45:33.900 the Friendship of many as well
04:45:36.298 I am also aware of the targeting of
04:45:38.700 religious and social conservatives
04:45:40.500 online by trolls and those opposed to
04:45:43.260 their views on traditional marriage and
04:45:45.600 family
04:45:46.620 we must therefore come down hard on
04:45:49.080 discrimination in all its forms in the
04:45:52.620 workplace in schools in the public
04:45:54.780 sphere
04:45:55.680 we should treat bullying and harassment
04:45:57.900 seriously be day in the physical or
04:46:01.080 virtual spaces for all parties in this
04:46:03.600 debate we must Endeavor to build a more
04:46:06.180 equal Society for all not just for one
04:46:10.798 because whatever the label applied to
04:46:13.440 each of us we must first acknowledge the
04:46:15.718 wholeness and dignity of each person as
04:46:18.360 an individual being
04:46:20.280 I acknowledge as well the passion and
04:46:22.320 drive that the lgbtq plus Community has
04:46:25.200 displayed over the years in their effort
04:46:27.480 to repeal section 377a
04:46:30.360 many members of the community and their
04:46:32.340 allies are measured responsible and
04:46:35.340 aware of the complexity of the issue in
04:46:37.560 our society
04:46:39.060 while we break down this barrier and
04:46:40.860 what is in the private sphere I continue
04:46:43.500 to believe strongly that this must not
04:46:45.420 lead to the breakdown of the institution
04:46:47.218 of marriage in the public sphere
04:46:50.580 Mr Deputy speaker I welcome the
04:46:53.160 Constitutional Amendment as an
04:46:54.958 affirmation of the role and importance
04:46:56.940 of traditional marriage and family in
04:46:58.798 shaping our society
04:47:00.600 I fully acknowledge as well that the
04:47:02.638 view May evolve in the distant future
04:47:04.740 but for now we have an opportunity in
04:47:08.580 this house to ensure that the
04:47:10.500 institution of marriage endures and is
04:47:12.480 champion and celebrated
04:47:14.820 on the basis of the passage of article
04:47:17.878 156 I also give my support for the
04:47:20.878 repeal of 377a
04:47:23.520 after the conclusion of all our debate
04:47:25.798 we must return to working together
04:47:28.680 Unity is not the absence of disagreement
04:47:32.100 but a consensus to agree to work
04:47:34.440 together in spite of those disagreements
04:47:37.980 Mr Deputy speaker I support both bills
04:47:41.100 thank you
04:47:43.860 um
04:47:46.680 Dr Vivian balakrishnan
04:47:57.480 Mr
04:47:58.980 Deputy speaker this is clearly not a
04:48:02.760 matter of foreign policy
04:48:05.940 but since my wife and I celebrate our
04:48:09.120 35th Anniversary today
04:48:12.718 and
04:48:15.360 thank you and I'm the proud parent of
04:48:19.620 four children and four grandchildren
04:48:23.700 I thought this was a debate which I
04:48:26.580 sought the opportunity to share some
04:48:29.520 personal
04:48:30.540 perspectives and that of my residence
04:48:34.260 I start with three propositions
04:48:38.458 traditional marriage has been venerated
04:48:43.680 in all societies
04:48:46.138 all civilizations
04:48:48.718 since time in Memorial first point
04:48:52.798 second
04:48:54.540 a marriage is far more than a legally
04:48:58.920 binding contract
04:49:01.020 between two
04:49:03.180 consenting adults
04:49:06.298 third
04:49:07.860 the rights of children
04:49:11.400 in fact are Paramount
04:49:13.560 and in fact Trump even
04:49:16.798 the mutual happiness of parents
04:49:20.400 so I start off with these three
04:49:22.760 propositions for your consideration
04:49:26.940 my life was transformed the first moment
04:49:30.420 I held my daughter
04:49:32.760 in my arms
04:49:35.580 for the first time in my life I helped
04:49:39.360 a precious new unique human being
04:49:44.760 utterly dependent on my wife and me
04:49:48.780 she may have been delivered by my wife
04:49:52.080 but my daughter
04:49:54.480 and now her children my grandchildren
04:49:57.718 have a future that goes hopefully far
04:50:01.620 beyond me
04:50:04.620 that moment was also the time that I
04:50:08.040 realized
04:50:09.480 just how much my parents loved me
04:50:13.020 and with some guilt
04:50:15.540 I realized that actually all of us
04:50:18.540 cannot possibly love our parents as much
04:50:22.500 as our parents love us
04:50:24.780 and any every single one of you here who
04:50:27.540 has been a parent I think has had that
04:50:29.040 experience and what it shows
04:50:31.920 is that
04:50:34.500 love flows down
04:50:37.798 the generations
04:50:39.718 it's actually mainly one way
04:50:44.458 and so parental love is really about
04:50:46.920 paying it forward
04:50:48.780 and it is this focus on forward
04:50:52.320 and the future
04:50:54.540 and that drives us drives all parents
04:50:59.280 to give the best possible start
04:51:03.420 to their children
04:51:05.520 this is what makes us so focused on
04:51:07.620 leaving the world in a better state
04:51:10.560 for our children to inherit
04:51:12.718 and you see it is this focus on the
04:51:15.298 future
04:51:16.200 on protecting nurturing saving investing
04:51:20.218 building
04:51:22.138 it is this future oriented Focus
04:51:26.400 that
04:51:27.780 affects
04:51:29.400 tone of our society and frankly even in
04:51:33.060 Parliament
04:51:34.378 it's why for me there's no such thing as
04:51:37.620 saving too much
04:51:39.298 for the future
04:51:40.860 because it's for them
04:51:43.020 and not for us
04:51:45.540 and even as we do that we are simply in
04:51:49.378 fact replicating
04:51:51.840 what our parents and grandparents did
04:51:53.940 for us
04:51:55.138 and so this is why I believe all
04:51:58.680 societies
04:52:00.060 all religions have always conferred a
04:52:03.840 sacred status
04:52:05.218 on the institution of marriage and this
04:52:08.940 is why this is a key pillar a key
04:52:11.638 prescription
04:52:13.440 for human progress and societies
04:52:16.280 everywhere since time immemorial
04:52:20.940 the second point
04:52:22.920 is that a marriage is far more than a
04:52:25.440 legally binding contract between two
04:52:27.480 consenting adults for the sake of their
04:52:30.180 Mutual happiness
04:52:32.400 my wife has often reminded me of an
04:52:35.458 aphorism
04:52:36.840 the best gift you can give your children
04:52:39.958 is to love the mother
04:52:43.500 initially I found this advice be music
04:52:47.638 but the more I thought about it
04:52:51.000 actually this advice
04:52:53.040 makes perfect sense
04:52:54.958 because you see children and in fact
04:52:57.780 think back to your own childhood
04:53:00.900 children need that reassurance that
04:53:03.240 sense of stability
04:53:05.700 of knowing that both parents are in a
04:53:09.480 committed loving relationship for the
04:53:12.240 long term
04:53:14.160 and that the parents both parents
04:53:17.280 will always be there for them
04:53:21.000 so in fact the way we approach our
04:53:23.820 marriage is not and should not be about
04:53:26.820 just optimizing
04:53:29.160 the happiness of two adults
04:53:31.920 but really
04:53:33.600 for the sake
04:53:34.980 of our children and their future
04:53:37.620 because if we are successful and if we
04:53:39.958 are blessed
04:53:41.100 then
04:53:42.180 we're good role models for our children
04:53:44.878 but our mistakes are sometimes our wrong
04:53:47.878 choices
04:53:49.798 have profound impact and implications
04:53:54.240 on our children
04:53:55.980 so my wife is right
04:53:57.958 love the mother
04:53:59.878 of your children
04:54:02.638 my third point
04:54:04.740 is that every child has a biological
04:54:08.218 father and mother but it's not just a
04:54:11.340 matter of biology and genes and
04:54:14.100 chromosomes
04:54:15.480 but think back to your own childhood
04:54:19.620 our mothers and our fathers
04:54:22.500 played essential
04:54:24.980 complementary
04:54:26.638 but not identical rules
04:54:29.580 complementary
04:54:31.138 but not identical rules and when I
04:54:33.780 served as minister in mcis
04:54:36.900 I studied the problem of children
04:54:41.040 in juvenile homes
04:54:43.080 or with dysfunctional social
04:54:45.780 circumstances
04:54:47.520 the single most important factor I often
04:54:51.000 found recurring was an absent father
04:54:54.540 and that's why one of the things which
04:54:56.638 I'm proudest about was to have been one
04:54:59.040 of the people behind the founding of
04:55:01.620 fathers for life
04:55:03.780 so yes I do believe absolutely with no
04:55:08.458 apology and With No Reservations in the
04:55:11.520 traditional family form
04:55:14.760 as an ideal
04:55:16.500 one man one woman
04:55:19.200 committed to each other
04:55:21.480 to bring up their children
04:55:24.420 in the context of a stable marriage
04:55:27.360 but having said that we also need to
04:55:30.000 acknowledge that
04:55:31.440 not everyone
04:55:33.180 will be so blessed
04:55:36.000 and enjoy such a simple straightforward
04:55:38.820 life
04:55:40.560 and that sometimes life does not go
04:55:43.680 according to plan
04:55:45.360 and all children
04:55:47.280 regardless of family circumstances
04:55:49.440 deserve our fullest support in fact
04:55:52.080 some children especially those in less
04:55:55.080 ideal circumstances
04:55:57.378 deserve and need additional support
04:56:00.958 which this house agrees with I'm sure
04:56:06.120 some of my
04:56:07.798 friends whom I've known for the longest
04:56:09.900 time
04:56:11.280 are gay
04:56:13.620 and
04:56:15.060 My Generation came of age
04:56:18.060 in the early 80s
04:56:21.420 the AIDS epidemic
04:56:23.400 had not yet been named or discovered
04:56:26.820 but it had started
04:56:29.940 and many of us were not quite aware of
04:56:33.600 the threat
04:56:36.000 the veil of ignorance the fear of
04:56:38.700 embarrassment
04:56:42.000 in fact contributed tragically
04:56:45.958 to The Cutting shot of lives of some of
04:56:49.320 my friends
04:56:51.900 but beyond that
04:56:53.820 in fact
04:56:55.620 I'm sure if you all speak to every
04:56:58.200 single one of your gay friends
04:57:01.080 a single one of them
04:57:03.420 has suffered the pain of rejection
04:57:07.020 of discrimination
04:57:09.000 and sometimes of violence
04:57:11.400 and they have suffered that
04:57:14.400 at home
04:57:15.840 in schools
04:57:17.820 and in the workplace
04:57:20.580 they crave
04:57:22.080 our understanding
04:57:24.000 of empathy our support
04:57:27.120 and our protection
04:57:29.218 and yet I think if many of us think back
04:57:32.940 to our school days
04:57:35.520 I think we all fell short I will confess
04:57:39.000 to having fallen short
04:57:40.740 and for that I apologize to my gay
04:57:43.920 friends
04:57:46.320 unfortunately this debate on section
04:57:50.060 377a of the penal code
04:57:54.718 section 377a has come to symbolize
04:57:59.000 simultaneously to
04:58:01.620 paradoxical imperatives
04:58:04.440 first
04:58:05.760 to protect the traditional family which
04:58:08.400 frankly is under considerable stress in
04:58:11.820 modern days
04:58:13.500 but equally important
04:58:16.440 there is also a duty to protect
04:58:19.680 our gay brothers
04:58:21.540 from victimization
04:58:23.878 and the fear and the pain
04:58:27.000 the dejection
04:58:28.680 end of rejection
04:58:31.260 there are no simple answers
04:58:33.540 to such apparently contradictory social
04:58:37.620 imperatives
04:58:40.860 SMS Sim n and I Deputy speaker
04:58:44.940 Christopher D'Souza instead with chair
04:58:47.458 come represent the GRC of Holland
04:58:50.820 located
04:58:52.378 to be frank with all of you the majority
04:58:55.138 of the feedback that we've received
04:58:57.120 online and in face to face
04:58:59.820 actually has the majority
04:59:03.060 have expressed great anxiety about
04:59:06.240 families anxiety about the repeal
04:59:10.080 and
04:59:11.820 a deeper anxiety about the future
04:59:14.760 of families
04:59:17.400 Minister Sean Morgan has explained and I
04:59:20.160 accept his explanation
04:59:22.138 that section 377a is at significant
04:59:25.138 legal risk of being struck down
04:59:28.138 so the Amendments proposed today
04:59:31.440 to repeal 377a
04:59:34.620 I believe helps us avoid
04:59:37.798 that abrupt and potentially disruptive
04:59:42.680 confrontation in a court of law with a
04:59:46.500 binary outcome
04:59:48.420 and with perhaps
04:59:50.400 unpredictable and sometimes
04:59:52.620 uncontrollable social and political
04:59:55.200 consequences
04:59:56.940 so I agree with him and I support the
05:00:01.440 repeal of 377a in that context
05:00:05.580 but I also support the amendment to the
05:00:08.160 Constitution that makes it clear
05:00:10.980 that the question of marriage will be
05:00:12.840 decided here in this house
05:00:16.020 it may not be all of us in the future it
05:00:18.660 will be a different house but it will be
05:00:21.120 decided through the political process
05:00:23.638 with all the engagement
05:00:26.540 discussion debate negotiations and
05:00:30.660 compromises which are needed
05:00:33.660 and that is the way you need to move
05:00:36.060 forward
05:00:37.020 similarly to my residents who've asked
05:00:39.900 for it to be entrenched
05:00:42.240 two-third majority and lock it up
05:00:46.080 and I have to tell them that actually
05:00:49.680 these are issues
05:00:51.480 which no amount of legal and
05:00:55.260 constitutional lockups
05:00:58.798 will decide for the future
05:01:01.798 the values the mores the attitudes of
05:01:05.878 our children and grandchildren we can
05:01:08.458 all do our best to instill values in
05:01:10.378 them but we've got to trust them
05:01:13.260 and trust them and entrust them with the
05:01:17.580 power and the authority to make
05:01:19.798 decisions in the future
05:01:21.718 so I also accept
05:01:23.820 this amendment
05:01:25.860 which makes it clear that the future
05:01:28.860 definition the current definition and if
05:01:32.340 there's going to be any future Amendment
05:01:34.560 will be decided in this house and not in
05:01:37.440 a corner flow
05:01:39.420 we do all this in full appreciation
05:01:42.600 of
05:01:44.280 the fact that difficult issues that go
05:01:47.638 to the heart of identity
05:01:50.160 deeply held values
05:01:52.378 and lived experience
05:01:54.298 are best settled through careful
05:01:56.940 respectful sincere discussions without
05:02:00.180 polemics without win-lose outcomes
05:02:03.840 and so it is in this spirit that I
05:02:05.700 support the Amendments move today
05:02:08.458 we have to find ways
05:02:11.340 to continue to protect this precious and
05:02:14.760 fragile Institution
05:02:16.798 of the traditional family
05:02:19.320 and marriage and we have to remember
05:02:23.160 that the welfare and the rights of our
05:02:26.820 children are Paramount
05:02:29.340 now in practice what that means
05:02:32.878 is policies and programs
05:02:35.340 that will
05:02:37.100 unambiguously
05:02:38.878 support the traditional family and
05:02:40.860 Parenthood
05:02:41.820 including adoption rights
05:02:44.400 housing priority baby bonuses
05:02:47.840 reproductive therapy it also means our
05:02:51.180 public messaging our education
05:02:53.760 in schools
05:02:55.620 and mass media
05:02:59.040 must continue to uphold these
05:03:02.580 traditional
05:03:03.958 family ideals
05:03:06.780 but having said that
05:03:09.600 you know in my earlier versions of the
05:03:11.820 speech I tried to say we can do all this
05:03:13.560 without discrimination
05:03:15.540 but actually in life
05:03:18.360 if you uplift one form
05:03:21.718 if you prioritize one type
05:03:26.218 of
05:03:27.600 social Arrangements
05:03:30.480 inevitably it means you have to choose
05:03:33.240 and it cannot be completely equal
05:03:36.420 but having said that
05:03:39.240 I believe a spirit of mutual respect
05:03:43.680 and perhaps more important than anything
05:03:46.138 else
05:03:47.280 compassion
05:03:49.138 can allow us to find that hopefully safe
05:03:53.638 landing Zone
05:03:55.200 where we can protect our families
05:03:57.780 and protect our gay brothers
05:04:00.420 so on that note as a deputy speaker I
05:04:03.660 support the Amendments standing before
05:04:05.878 the house today thank you all very much

05:11:45.740 Mr Deputy speaker I support the repeal
05:11:49.378 of section 377a of the penal code AS PM
05:11:53.280 had said in the
05:11:55.040 2022 National Day rally social attitudes
05:11:58.560 towards gay people have shifted
05:12:00.360 appreciably and the repeal of the
05:12:02.580 provision will bring the law into line
05:12:04.920 with current social mores this is an
05:12:07.500 important step towards respecting and
05:12:09.660 acknowledging gay singaporeans as an
05:12:12.240 integral part of the Singapore Society
05:12:15.240 the colonial law is outdated and it
05:12:18.000 ignores the objective reality that
05:12:20.340 Singapore is home to many gay citizens
05:12:22.440 and residents who are also contributing
05:12:24.958 members of the Singapore Society
05:12:27.240 to retain a law that criminalizes a
05:12:30.000 legitimate community of fellow
05:12:31.680 singaporeans in order to preserve
05:12:33.480 Traditional Values is at best a
05:12:36.000 stretched logic there are other better
05:12:38.218 ways to promote Traditional Values
05:12:40.620 while the repeal of section 377a is a
05:12:43.740 major step in the right direction we
05:12:45.780 should also we should also ensure that
05:12:48.000 public policies that affect gay
05:12:50.400 singaporeans in their everyday lives do
05:12:52.620 not result in any form of stigmatization
05:12:54.900 and discrimination on a practical level
05:12:58.620 I recognize that a significant segment
05:13:01.138 of the Singapore Society is still very
05:13:03.180 conservative some fear the repeal will
05:13:05.520 lead to a flood of changes to the
05:13:07.138 complexion of our society I also
05:13:09.660 recognize that there is an appropriate
05:13:11.400 time and place for all things however
05:13:14.180 amending some public policies to fairly
05:13:17.100 include gay singaporeans does not equate
05:13:19.620 to an erosion of the family as societies
05:13:22.080 building block like all singaporeans gay
05:13:25.860 citizens have everyday concerns about
05:13:27.900 life and livelihoods that public
05:13:29.878 policies can address without threatening
05:13:32.218 the current definition of marriage
05:13:34.798 we also should be mindful that social
05:13:36.780 norms change and evolve it may not be
05:13:39.480 prudent to adopt an immutable stance
05:13:41.700 towards any public policies as we may
05:13:44.340 find ourselves out of sync with the
05:13:45.900 realities on the ground in time to come
05:13:48.600 thus it may be pragmatic for the
05:13:51.180 government to always adopt an Adaptive
05:13:53.340 stance towards public policies including
05:13:56.280 policies affecting gay singaporeans
05:13:58.860 more importantly we must not forget that
05:14:01.320 gay singaporeans contribute economically
05:14:04.260 and socially to Singapore they are also
05:14:06.958 members of Singaporean families they
05:14:09.298 should be treated as full members of our
05:14:11.218 society and be accorded the respect and
05:14:13.740 support like any Singapore citizen as
05:14:16.680 such we should be careful to ensure that
05:14:19.138 our public policies do not marginalize
05:14:21.660 or pervade stigmatization or
05:14:23.580 discrimination against them
05:14:26.100 in the public discourse on the repeal of
05:14:29.040 section 377a so far I'm heartened to see
05:14:32.580 a lot more restraint exhibited in
05:14:35.280 comparison to what we saw back in 2007
05:14:37.620 when the repeal was first debated this
05:14:40.560 is a positive sign that our society has
05:14:42.600 evolved and we are able to discuss
05:14:44.878 difficult issues without being
05:14:46.620 inflammatory I hope I hope the forward
05:14:49.440 discourse will continue to be balanced
05:14:52.200 considered and secular
05:14:54.660 in a diverse and multifaceted Society
05:14:57.240 like ours fault lines exist everywhere
05:14:59.638 some are deep and old others are new and
05:15:02.820 emergent we only need to look around the
05:15:05.218 world to see many examples of how one's
05:15:07.798 inclusive and tolerant societies could
05:15:10.260 suddenly become severely polarized and
05:15:12.840 fractured as singaporeans we must
05:15:15.420 remember to always demonstrate
05:15:16.920 high-level respect and willingness to
05:15:19.620 engage with fellow citizens who hold
05:15:21.660 different views to promote social
05:15:23.700 harmony and cohesion our national values
05:15:26.580 should promote Mutual accommodation and
05:15:28.620 compassion among the different segments
05:15:31.260 of the Singapore Society
05:15:33.240 even if we cannot agree we must always
05:15:35.940 uphold mutual respect and be prepared to
05:15:38.458 listen and try to understand each other
05:15:40.980 in conclusion I hope we can continue to
05:15:43.860 work to eliminate all forms of
05:15:45.660 discrimination and learn to embrace all
05:15:48.180 fellow citizens as equal members of our
05:15:50.638 society while always maintaining mutual
05:15:53.280 respect and being accommodating towards
05:15:55.620 each other
05:15:56.700 with that I support the repeal of
05:15:58.378 section 377a of the penal code thank you
05:16:01.980 Miss Jessica tan
05:16:08.820 thank you Mr Deputy speaker
05:16:11.340 I'm speaking today on both the penal
05:16:13.560 code Amendment bill and the bill and the
05:16:15.660 amendment to the Constitution as many of
05:16:18.060 my residents have reached out and
05:16:20.040 written reached out or written to me
05:16:21.958 since PM's National Day rally speech on
05:16:25.080 the repeal of section 377a
05:16:27.780 did us that I share their concerns and
05:16:30.660 seek clarification to address the
05:16:32.458 apprehension
05:16:33.958 this is a difficult topic with differing
05:16:36.660 views but an important one for all
05:16:39.480 singaporeans at this point I should
05:16:42.660 share that my personal uh views on this
05:16:46.560 as well and I will say that it took me
05:16:49.200 quite a long time to write the speech my
05:16:52.020 speech is not long don't worry but it
05:16:54.298 took me a long time to write it because
05:16:56.458 I had to ask myself where do I stand on
05:16:59.760 this
05:17:00.480 and it you know as a parent and also
05:17:04.798 being an MP for the last 16 years and
05:17:07.138 seeing my residents and when they come
05:17:09.480 to me with the issues I have a very firm
05:17:12.240 belief that the family is the
05:17:14.040 Cornerstone of society and I really
05:17:16.320 believe it is the source of strength and
05:17:18.900 it's also the source of weakness and
05:17:21.240 therefore I Do Cherish the traditional
05:17:24.180 definition of family and
05:17:26.160 you know being a parent for
05:17:28.798 about 30 years more than 30 years now
05:17:31.560 and being married for 32 years over 32
05:17:35.040 years I will say to you as much as I
05:17:36.780 think I'm a good mother
05:17:38.638 I've realized that my husband and myself
05:17:41.120 play a very important role for three
05:17:44.040 children and I do want to preserve and
05:17:47.280 protect that definition of family
05:17:50.520 so let me now summarize
05:17:52.620 the apprehensions expressed by my
05:17:54.718 residents and what they sent her around
05:17:56.940 one
05:17:58.260 the safeguarding and the definition of
05:18:00.180 marriage as a union between men and a
05:18:03.060 woman and pro-family policies such as
05:18:05.700 public housing education adoption rules
05:18:09.020 and media standards
05:18:11.780 tool that the repeal of section 377a
05:18:15.298 will encourage gay activists to push the
05:18:18.360 agenda much further and this may cause
05:18:21.060 reactions and divisions in Singapore as
05:18:23.458 we see happening in many countries in
05:18:25.320 the world and the concern of my
05:18:26.878 residence is really the divisions and
05:18:29.878 what it may cause
05:18:32.100 and three protecting people from being
05:18:34.320 pressured bullied or discriminated
05:18:36.600 against when they do not support the
05:18:38.820 same ideas and beliefs whether to retain
05:18:41.638 or to repeal section 377a
05:18:45.600 many have shared that they feel that
05:18:47.580 section 377a is a unique Singapore
05:18:50.700 compromise its non-enforcement means our
05:18:53.878 colleagues friends Neighbors
05:18:57.540 and family members who identify
05:18:59.458 themselves as homosexuals are able to
05:19:02.040 live out their lives their private lives
05:19:04.620 while protecting
05:19:06.240 gay values from becoming mainstream
05:19:09.298 it has worked for Singapore so the
05:19:11.820 question is
05:19:13.080 why the need to make the change now
05:19:16.820 minister shanmugam has explained the
05:19:20.100 circumstances that there are real risks
05:19:22.260 that section 377a can be struck down
05:19:26.878 section 377a has been challenged
05:19:29.878 as unconstitutional and continues to be
05:19:32.580 challenged
05:19:33.540 the courts have judged that such matters
05:19:35.638 are sensitive societal issues and it and
05:19:39.120 it is for Parliament to decide
05:19:42.780 but the point is that if Parliament does
05:19:46.440 nothing
05:19:47.760 the courts will have to do what it has
05:19:50.580 to do when it has to do
05:19:53.218 and when that happens the apprehensions
05:19:56.280 that have been expressed will become
05:19:58.740 real
05:19:59.878 it is precisely that that the government
05:20:02.660 hearing the views of the majority is
05:20:06.180 acting
05:20:07.320 it is easier for the government to do
05:20:09.840 nothing
05:20:10.920 and in fact politically actually
05:20:13.980 much much easier
05:20:16.080 but given how controversial this issue
05:20:18.718 especially given how controversial this
05:20:20.458 issue is
05:20:21.600 however
05:20:23.040 that would be extremely irresponsible
05:20:26.218 as there is real risk and the Very
05:20:28.680 definition of marriage and the
05:20:30.840 pro-family policies that the majority
05:20:33.120 want to protect will be challenged as we
05:20:36.298 are already seeing in several countries
05:20:43.620 point of why we keep
05:20:45.660 77a I think it's also important that
05:20:49.680 I also share feedback that I've received
05:20:51.660 from residents that have friends
05:20:53.878 colleagues and neighbors and family
05:20:55.740 members as I've shared who are gay
05:20:57.780 members
05:20:58.860 they and even those that have asked for
05:21:01.860 the repeal of 377a
05:21:06.360 do not
05:21:07.560 do not view it as a crime that what
05:21:11.520 consenting adult uh gay men have and do
05:21:16.860 in private
05:21:18.480 but
05:21:19.620 what it stems more from the fact that of
05:21:22.378 the fear of what it means after that
05:21:25.440 so what the repeal of 377a really does
05:21:29.580 is
05:21:31.680 it removes the stigma and the hurt
05:21:36.180 that the gay in our community have been
05:21:39.420 feeling
05:21:41.040 and they make us and I want to say that
05:21:44.340 gay men gay males are fellow
05:21:46.920 singaporeans
05:21:48.060 as they are and they can be your
05:21:51.240 neighbor
05:21:52.200 your co-worker
05:21:54.360 your friend or even your family member
05:21:58.798 they contribute to and are part of our
05:22:00.958 society and they too deserve dignity and
05:22:04.080 respect
05:22:06.360 now let me touch on the proposed
05:22:08.160 amendment to the Constitution and the
05:22:10.320 insertion of the new article 156 and
05:22:13.260 whether they will be sufficient to
05:22:14.940 safeguard the definition of the
05:22:16.798 institution of marriage and the
05:22:18.540 associated pro-family policies
05:22:20.638 the new article 156 subsection 3 and
05:22:24.360 subsection 4 seek to protect the
05:22:26.520 definition of marriage in such laws like
05:22:28.560 the woman's Charter the administration
05:22:30.420 of the Muslim laws and laws that confer
05:22:32.580 rights and benefits on or in relation to
05:22:35.820 persons Merit underdose enactment from
05:22:38.280 constitutional challenges pro-family
05:22:40.740 policies of the government example in
05:22:42.900 regard to housing education and media
05:22:45.840 standards will therefore also be
05:22:47.760 protected
05:22:48.780 but the anxiety is if this would make it
05:22:51.360 easy for change as it will only require
05:22:53.520 a simple majority to amend the
05:22:55.500 definition of marriage I've received
05:22:57.660 feedback from some asking that the
05:22:59.280 definition of marriage be directly in
05:23:01.200 the Constitution so as to require a
05:23:04.200 two-thirds majority and not just a
05:23:06.000 simple majority to affect such a radical
05:23:08.400 redefinition
05:23:10.138 the proposed amendment I feel is a
05:23:12.840 balanced one as it protects the
05:23:15.240 traditional definition of marriage and
05:23:17.218 pro-family policies
05:23:18.900 while allowing our future Generations
05:23:22.320 to decide on social societal norms
05:23:26.040 to give further reassurance DPM Wong
05:23:28.980 has given Pap's commitment that the
05:23:31.378 definition of marriage as that of the
05:23:33.060 Union between men and a woman and will
05:23:35.160 not change under the watch of the
05:23:36.900 current leadership of PM Lee and if the
05:23:39.540 pap government were to win the next
05:23:41.100 general election it would not change
05:23:42.780 under his watch
05:23:44.580 those are reassurance that have been
05:23:47.878 given and I think that that's a balanced
05:23:50.520 approach and one that does seek to
05:23:52.920 protect
05:23:53.820 the definition that the majority want to
05:23:56.400 hold
05:23:57.660 finally I'd like to talk about the
05:24:00.000 cancer culture and bullying
05:24:01.860 we are hearing strong sentiments and
05:24:03.840 differing views with the debate around
05:24:06.000 the repeal of section 377a
05:24:08.638 from the reactions and feedbacks shared
05:24:10.920 an area that is of concern and we must
05:24:13.320 address is that of bullying and a cancer
05:24:15.958 culture
05:24:17.100 Youth and working professionals have
05:24:19.260 approached me and expressed fears and
05:24:21.900 anxieties with gay activism
05:24:24.360 some have shared that while they accept
05:24:26.100 their friends and family who identify as
05:24:28.080 gays they find it difficult to voice
05:24:30.420 their opinions when they do not share
05:24:32.400 their values and ideas for fear of being
05:24:34.740 labeled bullet or canceled in school or
05:24:37.740 at the workplace the fear real or
05:24:41.040 perceive is that the repeal of 377a will
05:24:44.040 amplify this activism
05:24:46.500 but similarly I would like to caution us
05:24:49.378 that with the debate on this repeal I we
05:24:52.740 are also seeing a heightened attention
05:24:55.260 on those that identify Escape
05:24:57.900 I also have residents expressing
05:25:00.060 concerns of possible discrimination
05:25:02.520 against those who identify themselves as
05:25:04.920 gay
05:25:05.878 so what is clear
05:25:07.680 is that this is a subject That Matters
05:25:11.160 to many regardless of whether we support
05:25:15.080 or retain or support the repeal all the
05:25:18.660 retention of section 377a
05:25:21.780 what we cannot allow is for any person's
05:25:25.740 regardless of which side they stand to
05:25:28.980 be labeled
05:25:30.138 discriminated or bullet
05:25:38.540 have shared that the agencies are
05:25:41.520 looking at ways to ensure that that
05:25:44.878 discrimination is not tolerated I would
05:25:47.580 ask and I would ask for more to be
05:25:51.120 shared as to what the details of these
05:25:53.700 are and to reassure
05:25:55.920 individuals and groups that they are put
05:25:58.260 that there are clear protections from
05:26:00.660 discriminatory pressures a cancer
05:26:02.878 culture and bullying in society in
05:26:06.180 schools and or at the workplace
05:26:09.540 the societal values and definition of
05:26:12.180 marriage family and policies affecting
05:26:15.420 our children are important for Singapore
05:26:18.360 and singaporeans
05:26:19.920 as we have done before I do appeal to
05:26:23.160 all regardless of where we stand on this
05:26:26.580 matter
05:26:27.540 we must work together and not allow this
05:26:30.540 to divide us
05:26:31.920 I do believe that while the Amendments
05:26:34.378 strive to provide the legislation to
05:26:36.600 preserve and protect our social norms
05:26:39.840 how we act will determine the Singapore
05:26:43.378 we have today
05:26:45.000 and in the future
05:26:46.920 I support the amendment
05:26:49.740 to the uh the penal code Amendment as
05:26:53.040 well as the amendment to the
05:26:55.080 Constitution thank you
05:26:58.980 Miss Cheryl Chan
05:27:08.340 Mr Deputy speaker in our 57 years of
05:27:11.940 Independence Singapore has pride
05:27:13.920 ourselves on being a multi-racial
05:27:15.840 multi-religious country
05:27:17.940 or diversity exists we have learned to
05:27:20.760 respect and allow different individuals
05:27:22.620 to practice their faith beliefs
05:27:24.420 traditions and religions
05:27:26.760 all this are possible because first we
05:27:29.820 have intentional policies in place to
05:27:31.860 enhance behaviors which are widely
05:27:33.600 acceptable or discourage certain
05:27:36.000 behaviors which are less accepted
05:27:38.760 second we learn to respect one another
05:27:41.340 from the values we learned or they are
05:27:44.100 taught in school and at home
05:27:46.378 that would define over time the country
05:27:49.020 we wish to live in and the societal
05:27:51.480 behaviors that most consider as norms
05:27:54.420 this is the basis I believed have bonded
05:27:57.000 us together and enabled us to live in
05:27:59.218 harmony task for
05:28:01.200 beneath this social model there still
05:28:03.718 lies frictions and differing views in
05:28:05.820 our country
05:28:07.020 some of these frictions all differences
05:28:09.180 are not easily soft or appreciated by
05:28:12.060 different groups as it is not simply an
05:28:14.160 assessment of right or wrong nor is it
05:28:16.680 about the louder voice times
05:28:19.138 especially not so when it comes to one's
05:28:21.840 preferences Liberty of choices and how
05:28:24.958 one can make others understand their
05:28:26.940 views and accept it without having
05:28:29.100 broader societal impact
05:28:31.440 if only things were straightforward
05:28:33.360 there would be hope to reduce conflicts
05:28:35.940 and more peace today
05:28:38.280 as it is with any evolving society when
05:28:41.520 the exposure to different facades of
05:28:43.440 Life become wider for most individuals
05:28:45.540 the reality is we are faced with a
05:28:48.240 gradation of expectations and
05:28:50.100 perceptions from the family friends
05:28:52.100 co-workers and Society
05:28:55.560 for us to move forward as a country
05:28:57.298 there needs to be more ability in us to
05:29:00.480 actively hear different viewpoints be
05:29:03.360 less biased beginning with lesser extent
05:29:05.458 of pre-judging people and for activists
05:29:08.100 not to plainly impress one's agenda on
05:29:11.160 others to accept regardless of others
05:29:13.080 preferences and values
05:29:15.240 how then can we achieve a calibrated
05:29:17.400 balance between one's beliefs and
05:29:19.260 practices without imposing on others
05:29:22.378 I believe this boils down to the values
05:29:24.958 that Define each of us and what we are
05:29:27.180 prepared to accept and adopt in our
05:29:29.040 lives
05:29:30.060 there are values which are considered
05:29:32.280 key tenets of a society's mainstream
05:29:34.980 those which most can accept and
05:29:37.080 acknowledge as norms
05:29:38.700 this values are those where people
05:29:41.820 freely Express and are naturally
05:29:43.740 accepted without being judged however we
05:29:47.280 must also recognize that there are other
05:29:49.080 values which serve some unique groups or
05:29:51.780 serve some purposes of being adopted by
05:29:53.878 some but are not commonly observed
05:29:56.218 amongst our daily lives
05:29:58.560 this is where management of social
05:30:00.240 expectations and perceptions play a role
05:30:03.298 personally I was raised on the values
05:30:05.638 where family centricity is key
05:30:08.100 one where marriage is the finest between
05:30:10.260 one men and women this is what I also
05:30:13.740 wish to see remain as a beliefs
05:30:15.660 teachings and practices in our education
05:30:18.180 system
05:30:19.440 well I think many may share this view we
05:30:22.500 should not be oblivious that our next
05:30:24.900 generation will not have access to
05:30:26.940 information that influences them about
05:30:29.458 homosexuality all sensitive topics just
05:30:33.120 because it is not taught or spoke about
05:30:34.740 in mainstream schools
05:30:36.540 by not having it as mainstream we can at
05:30:39.000 best defer the exposure of our young
05:30:41.040 ones to a later stage when they are more
05:30:43.320 mature to differentiate or make sound
05:30:45.060 decisions Independents need
05:30:47.458 thus I firmly believe that to repeal
05:30:50.298 377a it must be done on the grounds
05:30:52.980 where the recognized legal Union
05:30:55.200 between a man and woman is also strongly
05:30:58.020 protected by the definition within the
05:31:00.120 Constitution
05:31:02.218 well now we can take reference of this
05:31:04.620 in the form of article 156 if it is
05:31:07.320 passed we must ensure that the
05:31:09.600 government stand by this firmly as we
05:31:12.180 consider any future amendments to the
05:31:14.878 legislations or even the repeals
05:31:17.580 particularly so for hours is many of
05:31:19.980 today's legislations are designed with
05:31:22.620 the family unit being the fundamental
05:31:24.600 social fabric
05:31:26.580 take the housing policy as an example
05:31:31.798 today the hdb public housing can be
05:31:34.620 purchased or rented by those who have a
05:31:37.138 family nucleus
05:31:38.580 but housing demands come from many
05:31:40.980 groups besides those with a family
05:31:42.780 nucleus these groups include the
05:31:45.298 American singles single parents with or
05:31:47.520 without children lone seniors and more
05:31:50.638 they too have a need for basic housing
05:31:52.740 but the applications are currently
05:31:54.540 considered
05:31:57.000 or are currently limited sorry a
05:32:00.120 currency either limited by conditions or
05:32:02.400 considered on a case-by-case basis
05:32:04.740 hence this brings about the question of
05:32:07.080 fairness if the definition of family
05:32:09.298 nucleus for married couple changes
05:32:12.298 for need as basic as housing
05:32:15.000 this becomes a tricky situation home
05:32:17.760 then should be given access to public
05:32:19.620 housing and in a timely manner
05:32:22.560 sir what may not be a social Norm today
05:32:25.740 that is publicly expressed and accepted
05:32:27.900 does not imply that it cannot be
05:32:30.298 privately practiced by various groups
05:32:32.160 who adopted as their way of living
05:32:35.100 similarly this also does not indicated
05:32:38.160 that those who do not believe or adopted
05:32:40.740 should ostracize individuals who are
05:32:43.080 different from themselves
05:32:44.878 every family every Community every
05:32:47.638 individual have the right to choose what
05:32:50.218 is comfortable for their lives
05:32:52.080 but as individuals regardless of our
05:32:54.420 beliefs and inclination we should not
05:32:56.820 impress upon others that they must
05:32:58.500 embrace our way of living
05:33:00.718 with time and ability of individuals to
05:33:03.180 perceive different Norms the values of
05:33:05.760 what Define us as a society will
05:33:07.860 naturally surface
05:33:09.780 that's so I believe that let's not allow
05:33:12.660 divisive voices to break us apart but
05:33:15.240 rather for us to consider when and how
05:33:17.580 we want to be inclusive for maintaining
05:33:19.620 our own beliefs and values thank you
05:33:25.820 Mr Daryl David
05:33:39.298 Mr Deputy speaker
05:33:41.400 even before this debate started in the
05:33:43.798 house we had already had widespread
05:33:45.780 debate and exchanges of views regarding
05:33:48.420 this matter across various platforms and
05:33:51.000 in the community
05:33:52.440 the responses and emotions were mixed
05:33:54.540 from disappointment that the repeal was
05:33:56.940 not enough to concern that societal
05:33:59.520 norms and values would be challenged and
05:34:01.920 even eventually possibly changed
05:34:04.260 indeed in the run-up to this
05:34:05.940 parliamentary sitting I've often been
05:34:07.440 asked what My Views are on the matter
05:34:09.240 and one particular question that I was
05:34:11.940 asked which stuck with me was it was Pro
05:34:15.180 repeal or pro-family
05:34:18.120 now these were terms that made me
05:34:19.860 realize how polarizing the issue was for
05:34:22.440 many people who took a binary view of
05:34:24.240 the matter for them it was either one or
05:34:27.540 the other
05:34:28.740 my reply was to that person who asked me
05:34:31.260 and is
05:34:33.240 that I'm Pro people and pro Singapore
05:34:36.420 and these are two principles that I've
05:34:38.100 always strongly believed in and is why
05:34:40.440 I'm speaking today in supports of this
05:34:43.200 bill and the subsequent repeal of 377a I
05:34:47.218 would like to address the issue of why
05:34:48.920 377a should be repealed first
05:34:52.440 Mr Deputy speaker where we use the term
05:34:54.360 community and Society we have to
05:34:57.000 acknowledge that these are larger
05:34:58.740 entities that are made up of individuals
05:35:01.320 they are made up of people
05:35:03.600 of people and no one no one is exactly
05:35:06.660 alike we look different we think
05:35:08.700 different we have different beliefs we
05:35:10.798 have different cultures we have
05:35:12.420 different values we have different
05:35:13.798 Lifestyles and yes we have different
05:35:15.900 sexual preferences and practices
05:35:18.900 now what truly includes
05:35:20.400 to his Society consists of people
05:35:23.638 who are willing to not just tolerate but
05:35:26.400 actually accept those who are different
05:35:28.080 from them and those who are different
05:35:30.120 should not be discriminated
05:35:32.280 against in any way
05:35:34.620 as such while I understand the legal
05:35:36.780 Arguments for the repeal of 377a I would
05:35:39.780 like to say that it's even more
05:35:40.920 important for us to recognize the need
05:35:42.660 to repeal 377a from the perspective of
05:35:45.600 moral integrity
05:35:47.040 now you might ask how would you define
05:35:48.660 moral Integrity I think simply put moral
05:35:51.660 Integrity is doing the right thing
05:35:53.638 because it's the right thing to do
05:35:56.878 now two men having sex in private in
05:35:59.520 private is precisely that a private and
05:36:02.820 in my opinion a personal matter and it
05:36:04.980 should not be something that is regarded
05:36:06.900 as Criminal
05:36:08.100 in this regard I believe that repealing
05:36:10.400 377a is thus the right thing to do
05:36:13.440 because it's the right thing to do
05:36:16.740 repealing this law sends a strong signal
05:36:18.840 that we do recognize and respect
05:36:20.458 individual differences and that
05:36:22.440 different groups are welcome in our
05:36:24.060 community
05:36:25.378 which brings me to my next point about
05:36:27.120 people community and conversations
05:36:29.520 because we now have to look at the issue
05:36:31.560 also from the different perspective of
05:36:33.780 how while a community and Society is
05:36:36.000 made up of people as I mentioned earlier
05:36:38.580 these people do not live in isolated
05:36:41.520 silos but have to live and function
05:36:43.200 within the larger entity of a community
05:36:45.600 now in this regard the changes that the
05:36:48.060 government is affirming with the
05:36:49.920 definition of marriage of what
05:36:51.420 constitutes a family and related social
05:36:53.580 policies are done in the context of what
05:36:56.520 it feels would work for our Singaporean
05:36:58.680 Community had been taken into account
05:37:00.740 various opinions and views on the matter
05:37:05.040 now differences in opinions such as
05:37:06.840 those arising from a topic such as the
05:37:08.580 repeal of section 377a can lead
05:37:11.100 different groups to clashing head-on
05:37:13.260 over issues it may lead to a society
05:37:15.958 fracturing over fault lines because of
05:37:18.360 the different hectoring voices that
05:37:20.400 shout others down
05:37:22.020 however and this is my sincere hope such
05:37:24.840 differences if looked at rationally
05:37:27.298 can also be an opportunity an
05:37:29.580 opportunity for Frank and open dialogue
05:37:32.040 to look at the debate and embrace
05:37:34.138 different perspectives and viewpoints
05:37:37.080 are these conversations based on mutual
05:37:39.360 respect can help us evolve into a more
05:37:41.820 inclusive Society one that is richer
05:37:44.040 through plurality and diversity
05:37:47.820 enshrining anything in law is important
05:37:50.100 but equally important is the value of
05:37:52.440 open discussion and mutual respect
05:37:55.620 it's also important not to embrace a
05:37:57.900 cancer culture or to automatically rule
05:38:00.000 out someone who holds different views or
05:38:02.040 even someone who decides to look at the
05:38:03.480 topic conservatively
05:38:05.400 well still we should not go back to
05:38:07.620 labeling and stereotyping even though I
05:38:10.200 know I just use the term conservatively
05:38:12.480 what does liberal mean what what does
05:38:15.000 conservative mean
05:38:16.620 my view is that it would be good to
05:38:18.298 allow others their views
05:38:20.638 even it may seem more traditional less
05:38:23.878 Progressive there go the labels again
05:38:25.740 when built through certain lenses so I
05:38:28.260 know it's not easy it's not it's not
05:38:30.600 possible but it is really my view that
05:38:32.820 we are able to allow others with a
05:38:35.458 different opinion for us to speak to
05:38:38.100 have their voices heard
05:38:39.600 fast to have this dialogue
05:38:42.480 I don't like to move into education and
05:38:44.820 schools with the deputy speaker I
05:38:46.980 believe it would be good to consider
05:38:48.120 education and consider how the schools
05:38:50.280 can play a part in nurturing open
05:38:52.260 conversations so this topic is handled
05:38:54.180 sensitively
05:38:55.740 our schools must be safe places for
05:38:57.958 students to engage in respectful
05:38:59.400 conversations or debates with others who
05:39:02.040 may hold contrary opinions
05:39:04.138 through the through the careful
05:39:05.400 management of discussions and
05:39:06.900 controversial issues schools can help
05:39:09.120 promote freedom of expression as well as
05:39:11.160 inclusion and tolerance
05:39:13.500 now in doing so I believe they would
05:39:15.600 encourage Mutual understanding and
05:39:17.160 acceptance and in many ways sensitive
05:39:19.620 handling of these challenging issues
05:39:21.120 would be a form of modeling of open
05:39:23.400 discussion
05:39:25.020 there could also be instances where
05:39:26.638 students themselves are exploring their
05:39:29.218 own identity and having trained
05:39:31.138 Educators who could help them in this
05:39:32.700 journey of Discovery would be important
05:39:35.760 so I feel it would be good if the
05:39:37.138 government could consider how educators
05:39:38.878 could be trained to handle these issues
05:39:40.680 and other related topics that might
05:39:42.780 emerge from this debate
05:39:45.600 the deputy speaker in one of my previous
05:39:47.878 speeches I referred to the Singaporean
05:39:50.458 identity as a quilt a patchwork of many
05:39:53.878 cultures and multiple identities that we
05:39:55.980 have stitched together and that has
05:39:57.780 stayed together over the past 55 years
05:40:00.958 I then made the point that like any
05:40:03.060 quilt in time we do have occasional
05:40:05.040 tears in the fabric and some parts of
05:40:07.500 the quilt are freeing at the edges
05:40:10.740 perhaps these parts are parts of our
05:40:12.958 community that we haven't always heard
05:40:15.080 engaged or connected with and who are
05:40:18.000 somehow feeling that they're like a
05:40:19.920 discarded scrap of cloth rather than
05:40:21.900 part of a beautiful and wonderful quilt
05:40:24.718 but I believe that what continues to
05:40:26.638 connect us what will help mend the tears
05:40:29.040 and strengthen the fabric and our quilt
05:40:30.840 will be the strong threads that start
05:40:33.000 with conversation dialogue and
05:40:35.760 understanding and all done with respect
05:40:38.940 so while this debate might be settled in
05:40:41.340 the house over the next couple of days I
05:40:43.798 hope that the different groups in our
05:40:45.298 society will continue to have important
05:40:47.760 and relevant conversations and treat one
05:40:50.458 another with dignity and respect so we
05:40:52.920 can indeed work towards the Singapore
05:40:54.660 that emerges stronger
05:40:57.360 with that I conclude my speech in
05:40:59.218 support of the bill and the repeal of
05:41:01.878 377a thank you sir
05:41:06.060 Minister masagos would you like to move
05:41:08.458 Exempted business
05:41:16.980 Mr Speaker I beg to move that the
05:41:19.080 proceedings on the business sat down on
05:41:20.820 the order paper for today we Exempted at
05:41:23.400 this day sitting from the operations of
05:41:25.200 standing order number two
05:41:28.020 the question is the motion moved by the
05:41:31.138 minister as many as of the opinions say
05:41:34.020 I
05:41:35.160 to the contrary say no
05:41:37.320 I think the eyes have it the eyes have
05:41:40.378 it
05:41:42.240 Miss John Pereira
05:41:57.060 Mr Speaker sir the government's
05:41:59.940 rationale for the repeal of 377a has
05:42:04.138 been laid out quite clearly over the
05:42:06.900 past few months
05:42:08.218 however I would like to express my worry
05:42:11.520 that fault lines are being drawn in our
05:42:14.580 society as a result of the views of
05:42:17.638 various groups in our society occupying
05:42:20.340 the center stage on this issue
05:42:23.520 the concerns and aspirations of every
05:42:26.638 Singaporean should be heard and should
05:42:29.760 be valued especially on such issues that
05:42:33.420 matter to all of us
05:42:35.340 for most of the voices that are speaking
05:42:38.100 up they have come from a place of love a
05:42:42.360 love for the future of this country a
05:42:45.060 love for the future of our people and
05:42:48.120 our society and a love for this world
05:42:53.160 there are members of our community who
05:42:56.100 have difficulty accepting the
05:42:58.020 implications that they feared would come
05:43:00.718 with the repeal of section 377a the fear
05:43:05.160 is about losing the fundamental values
05:43:07.740 that we have built our society on and
05:43:11.100 the fabric that holds us together
05:43:13.860 to me this fear comes from a position of
05:43:18.000 love
05:43:18.840 not of hate
05:43:20.700 as they love the country and community
05:43:23.660 that we have built and are worried about
05:43:27.240 it being damaged
05:43:30.000 there are also members of our community
05:43:32.360 who feel that the repeal of 377a has
05:43:36.718 been long overdue and some of them are
05:43:39.780 also hoping that our societal Norms can
05:43:43.200 further evolve and become more liberal
05:43:45.900 towards different types of marriages and
05:43:49.080 Families
05:43:50.280 this set of views also stems from a
05:43:53.878 place of love where they would like to
05:43:57.058 embrace differences and allow everyone
05:44:00.298 to pursue whatever lifestyle they so
05:44:03.958 desire
05:44:06.440 unfortunately we have also come across
05:44:09.718 voices who do not come from a place of
05:44:12.718 love but would rather stir hatred and
05:44:16.320 misunderstanding within our society and
05:44:19.740 these are the ones who are drawing and
05:44:22.320 then exploiting fault lines within our
05:44:25.320 social fabric
05:44:26.820 such views can come from any quarter of
05:44:29.820 society and may even be disguised as
05:44:32.878 supporters of any of the positions that
05:44:35.638 I had mentioned above but the ultimate
05:44:38.520 aim is to push Singapore to an extreme
05:44:41.400 corner of the spectrum without
05:44:43.680 consideration as to whether this would
05:44:46.440 be good for us
05:44:48.058 some of these could also be driven or
05:44:50.940 initiated by Foreign elements with an
05:44:53.940 Insidious agenda given the borderless
05:44:57.120 nature of social media and the internet
05:45:01.260 we are a small and closely knit Nation
05:45:04.580 our society cannot afford to be
05:45:07.920 polarized by this issue we have already
05:45:11.160 so many challenges facing us as families
05:45:14.638 as communities and as a nation we need
05:45:18.660 to unite and fight as one to overcome
05:45:21.780 the many difficulties which lie ahead
05:45:24.780 the covet pandemic is not yet over
05:45:29.520 we have to deal with the rising cost of
05:45:32.400 living amid increasing Global tensions
05:45:35.280 and geopolitical conflicts we need to
05:45:38.760 combat social and income inequality and
05:45:42.240 strive to make sure that no Singaporean
05:45:44.700 is Left Behind
05:45:46.740 I hope that cool hits will prevail and
05:45:50.520 we can all take a step back and
05:45:53.040 understand one another's positions and
05:45:56.100 work together as a society to bridge any
05:45:59.458 differences let us all be more
05:46:01.798 understanding of and respectful towards
05:46:04.500 one another so that no one will feel
05:46:07.400 discriminated against this is one aspect
05:46:10.920 where we individuals have Choice thank
05:46:14.160 you
05:46:15.958 foreign
05:46:39.620 that Singapore will repeal section 377a
05:46:42.900 of the penal code and amend the
05:46:44.280 Constitution to protect the definition
05:46:46.080 of marriage reflects the common
05:46:48.180 agreement that many believe our gay
05:46:50.638 citizens have a place in society and
05:46:53.040 should not be treated as criminals and
05:46:55.260 in Singapore marriage between a man and
05:46:58.020 woman Remains the fundamental building
05:46:59.878 blocks of a family
05:47:01.558 Mr Speaker I'd like to touch on a few
05:47:03.900 points one three seven seven a as a
05:47:06.540 penal code issue two protection of
05:47:09.000 current social and family Norms three
05:47:11.400 preventing increasingly aggressive and
05:47:14.160 divisive activism
05:47:16.620 Mr Speaker there remains some concern
05:47:19.798 that the repeal of 377a will lead to a
05:47:22.680 drastic change in social norms such as
05:47:25.320 how managers would be defined in the
05:47:27.000 future sexuality educations in schools
05:47:29.400 and what can or cannot be screened on
05:47:31.860 televisions and in the cinema
05:47:33.780 however we have to consider how since
05:47:36.240 2007 when 377a was last debated social
05:47:39.840 acceptance for homosexuality has shifted
05:47:42.360 appreciably as mentioned by PM Lee back
05:47:45.120 then it was decided not to actively
05:47:47.218 enforce 377a
05:47:49.080 in addition to shifting societal values
05:47:51.540 we have to also consider the significant
05:47:53.520 risk of section 377a being struck down
05:47:56.520 in the court of law on the ground that
05:47:58.260 it breaches the provisions of equal
05:47:59.760 protection in our constitution as
05:48:01.980 discussed extensively by minshan earlier
05:48:05.218 it has been unsuccessfully challenged in
05:48:07.260 the past before but it will be Reckless
05:48:09.120 of us do not consider this and the
05:48:11.218 ramifications if it was struck down
05:48:13.340 without any protection on the definition
05:48:16.138 of marriage as how our society values it
05:48:20.820 Mr Speaker while I appreciate that there
05:48:24.000 are some reservations and concerns from
05:48:26.400 certain segments of society most of us
05:48:28.798 agree that two males committing sexual
05:48:31.620 act or acts of gross indecency as the
05:48:34.320 law puts it in private should not be
05:48:36.718 punished by imprisonment of up to two
05:48:38.760 years
05:48:39.660 hence it is only right that we consider
05:48:42.780 to repeal 377a in our penal code
05:48:45.660 we acknowledge
05:48:47.218 that we are still a largely conservative
05:48:49.440 Society but okay citizens have a place
05:48:51.900 in society and should not be treated as
05:48:54.780 criminals
05:48:56.520 while in general more accepting of
05:48:58.740 homosexuality now we are also very
05:49:00.780 concerned about protecting the current
05:49:03.360 social and family Norms with a repeal of
05:49:06.780 377a how can we effectively Safeguard
05:49:09.420 our social norms and values and in
05:49:11.458 particular the institution of marriage
05:49:13.680 which is currently defined as being that
05:49:15.780 between men and women
05:49:17.940 we must also understand how this
05:49:19.620 definition underpins various National
05:49:21.840 policies such as housing and education
05:49:24.240 hence it is even more necessary for us
05:49:26.878 to ensure that current social and family
05:49:28.860 Norms are protected
05:49:31.320 undoubted undoubtedly there are strong
05:49:33.900 views for and against the repeal of 377a
05:49:37.920 and the amendment to the Constitution
05:49:41.100 there are concerns that there will be
05:49:42.840 increased activism on both ends of the
05:49:45.660 Spectrum which can potentially be
05:49:47.820 aggressive and more importantly divisive
05:49:51.000 to our society
05:49:52.980 I think it is necessary for us to accept
05:49:55.620 this as a consensus
05:49:57.958 the best possible outcome given the
05:50:00.480 various viewpoints and deliberations
05:50:02.280 with regards to all the various groups
05:50:04.680 of people religious non-religious
05:50:06.900 organizations and the community which
05:50:08.878 has been ongoing since 2007 and before
05:50:13.260 while we should not curtail or suppress
05:50:15.480 social activism for causes that our
05:50:17.878 citizens believe in
05:50:19.378 we must also caution against extreme
05:50:21.718 views and actions that may prove to be
05:50:24.240 divisive to our society
05:50:26.400 in time to come should values and Norms
05:50:29.218 here in Singapore appreciably shift
05:50:31.138 again then we should be able to come
05:50:33.058 together sharing our views and reaching
05:50:36.120 a consensus on how we best move forward
05:50:39.780 activities in both camps did not think
05:50:41.700 that they should resort to drastic
05:50:43.920 measures to highlight their course nor
05:50:46.378 should any of us be influenced by
05:50:48.780 Foreign developments including pushing
05:50:51.000 values from multinational corporations
05:50:52.860 which are not aligned with our
05:50:54.958 Singaporean values
05:50:57.020 Singapore's laws are its own and we need
05:51:00.480 not follow the lead of other countries
05:51:02.280 if it did not if it does not suit
05:51:05.340 the values and disposition of our
05:51:07.558 citizens

05:54:35.458 Mr Speaker admittedly however this is
05:54:38.940 not the end of our conversation on this
05:54:40.798 topic just like all the other issues
05:54:42.540 that we face in society
05:54:44.340 Society is dynamic and ever-changing
05:54:47.100 hence we must continue to keep future
05:54:50.100 dialogue civil rational and most
05:54:53.458 importantly beneficial for Singapore as
05:54:56.100 a whole
05:54:57.480 we only have to look around us to see
05:54:59.820 how issues can be made very divisive if
05:55:02.878 everyone insists on their entrenched
05:55:05.160 views and not hear each other out and
05:55:07.860 come to a compromise
05:55:09.660 what we like to repeal 377a we will also
05:55:12.420 like to protect the prevailing
05:55:14.218 definition of marriage while still
05:55:16.080 allowing recourse in the future
05:55:18.660 how then do we protect the definition of
05:55:20.820 marriage something which we all value as
05:55:23.580 a society
05:55:25.138 by ensuring that the definition of
05:55:26.878 marriage is dependent of the parliament
05:55:29.280 and Parliament will define marriage
05:55:30.958 based on the prevailing values and views
05:55:32.638 of the Singaporean Society at any given
05:55:35.040 point of time
05:55:36.240 and at this juncture I wish to thank PMD
05:55:39.058 and dpm1 for the clear assurance that
05:55:41.580 the pap government will continue to
05:55:43.860 uphold our family-centered policies and
05:55:46.260 is fully committed to that and will
05:55:47.940 continue to uphold marriage as defined
05:55:49.860 between men and women
05:55:51.660 in this way even if one does not agree
05:55:54.600 with the repeal of 377a at least the
05:55:57.540 definition of marriage is preserved for
05:55:59.580 the time being in our constitution on
05:56:01.860 the other hand
05:56:02.878 for those who welcome the repeal and
05:56:05.040 look Beyond decriminalization there is
05:56:07.798 room for the for the definitions to
05:56:09.900 change when public opinion values and
05:56:12.180 non-nums differ
05:56:13.920 I think this is a viable compromise for
05:56:16.320 society to move forward for now
05:56:19.200 with the points considered earlier Mr
05:56:20.940 Speaker sir I do support the repeal and
05:56:24.058 the amendments to the Constitution thank
05:56:26.458 you
05:56:28.378 Mr mock tree
05:56:55.620 Mr Speaker
05:56:57.058 section 377a of the penal code is a
05:56:59.878 complex topic one that has been
05:57:02.040 passionately debated in and out of this
05:57:04.080 house
05:57:04.920 I'm glad that Singapore's government has
05:57:06.900 decided to finally repeal 377a I believe
05:57:10.138 section 377a is no longer relevant in
05:57:13.138 contemporary Singaporean Society I agree
05:57:15.420 with its repeal
05:57:17.280 I would also like to State my support
05:57:18.958 for the inclusion of article 156 of the
05:57:21.420 Constitution which clarifies the power
05:57:23.580 to make laws to do with the institution
05:57:25.740 of marriage rightly invest with this
05:57:28.260 very Parliament
05:57:29.638 and for Parliament to protect the
05:57:31.320 prevailing definition of marriage
05:57:33.360 this could potentially be a divisive
05:57:35.458 issue but it may not be
05:57:38.100 I see it instead as an opportunity to
05:57:40.798 open meaningful conversations about
05:57:42.180 equality and inclusivity within our
05:57:44.638 society
05:57:46.080 equality being one of our nation's
05:57:48.480 ideals
05:57:50.218 we need to ensure that policy is
05:57:52.260 implemented to uphold equal protection
05:57:54.600 of Rights for singaporeans who do not
05:57:56.878 fit squarely into the definition of
05:57:58.860 traditional family unit
05:58:00.780 so for instance single parent households
05:58:04.260 and lgbtq singaporeans amongst others
05:58:07.020 after all these people and many others
05:58:11.160 not mentioned contribute to the diverse
05:58:13.500 vibrant welcoming society that is so
05:58:16.138 admired around the world
05:58:17.580 do our policies recognize this and are
05:58:20.638 we doing enough for them
05:58:22.500 in this regard I would like to put
05:58:24.360 forward the following suggestions
05:58:27.120 first can pmo consider coordinating a
05:58:30.780 policy review across the whole of
05:58:32.580 government and ensure that those who are
05:58:35.700 not married are actively considered as
05:58:38.280 part of the policy making process
05:58:41.940 other jurisdictions such as the European
05:58:44.458 Union have undertaken similar reviews in
05:58:46.860 ensuring that all citizens regardless of
05:58:48.900 their background are not unfairly
05:58:50.760 discriminated against
05:58:52.440 this also ties into the ongoing forward
05:58:54.600 Singapore exercise as we refresh also
05:58:57.958 show compact to pursue a more equal and
05:59:00.420 inclusive Society
05:59:03.180 second will be on education for our
05:59:05.760 children
05:59:06.840 are we doing enough to ensure that our
05:59:08.760 children understand that even though
05:59:10.500 their peers may not fit into the
05:59:12.480 definition of a traditional family unit
05:59:15.660 either because of their home situation
05:59:17.700 or their personal realities
05:59:19.920 that these peers should not be treated
05:59:22.080 differently or Worse the Riff is
05:59:24.958 derivatively
05:59:28.138 I would like to encourage Moe to have
05:59:31.440 meaningful conversations with students
05:59:33.780 not for the purposes of problem solving
05:59:36.660 but to seek understanding I would like
05:59:39.298 to see more education content on
05:59:41.580 handling relationships not just the
05:59:43.620 natural in the heterosexual sense but
05:59:46.020 all definitions of relationships I agree
05:59:48.958 with my parliamentary colleague here at
05:59:51.540 The Honorable member Daryl David that
05:59:53.940 you know school should be a safe space
05:59:55.500 to explore to debate to educate about
05:59:58.138 respect and and inclusivity and you know
06:00:01.860 we should train our teachers to have
06:00:04.500 productive conversations with students
06:00:06.660 about these
06:00:08.160 so in conclusion Mr Speaker sir
06:00:10.920 regardless of where all this all in this
06:00:13.680 house stand I think we all agree that we
06:00:16.860 want the best for our country and our
06:00:19.020 people for a prosperous inclusive and
06:00:21.240 forward-looking Singapore
06:00:22.920 during his speech to announce
06:00:24.360 Singapore's independence from Malaysia
06:00:26.160 on 9th August 1965. our Founding Father
06:00:29.638 Lee Kuan Yew said quote
06:00:32.100 everyone will have his place equal
06:00:35.700 language culture religion unquote
06:00:40.020 we are thus compelled to move in this
06:00:42.360 direction and ensure that every
06:00:44.040 Singaporean can live a joyful happy and
06:00:46.920 peaceful life and contribute
06:00:48.240 meaningfully to this great nation
06:00:51.058 it is based on these ideals for a better
06:00:54.240 Singapore that were first articulated
06:00:56.878 more than five decades ago
06:00:58.740 that we have built this inclusive Global
06:01:01.260 city which we are all proud to call home
06:01:03.660 today
06:01:04.920 Singapore has indeed become a beacon for
06:01:07.740 many and while conservative in our
06:01:10.320 nature we are a tolerant peaceful and
06:01:13.440 harmonious Society where everyone can
06:01:16.260 live in community without fear
06:01:19.020 I hope that one day we will not have to
06:01:21.718 rely on the Constitution to safeguard
06:01:23.400 respect and celebrate our differences
06:01:25.920 where
06:01:27.240 there is a lot more binding us together
06:01:30.718 as singaporeans I love for food being
06:01:33.120 gyasu being champion grumblers
06:01:36.000 then what differentiates us
06:01:38.940 we have built a society based on
06:01:40.920 interracial and inter-religious Harmony
06:01:42.900 I'm certain we can establish a similarly
06:01:45.900 harmonious relationship between each
06:01:48.660 other regardless of our differences in
06:01:51.600 fact we can learn to welcome protect and
06:01:54.298 even celebrate those differences as one
06:01:57.240 diverse inclusive harmonious nation of
06:01:59.700 singaporeans
06:02:03.718 let me send request
06:02:13.378 Mr Speaker sir I stand in support of the
06:02:16.020 Amendments proposed today
06:02:17.700 our society's view on 377a has evolved
06:02:20.580 over time
06:02:21.600 part of it can be attributed to our
06:02:23.520 youth today
06:02:24.718 therefore I believe I can best
06:02:26.100 contribute to the debate by highlighting
06:02:28.080 the views
06:02:29.638 most of our youth won 377a gone
06:02:33.120 because it suggests
06:02:35.100 that some fingerprints are less than
06:02:36.958 others
06:02:38.100 the views of our youth are not solely
06:02:39.900 attributed to the influx of work culture
06:02:42.180 from the West there's a more fundamental
06:02:45.058 reason
06:02:46.138 and that is for the past few decades we
06:02:48.420 have been building a kind of Singapore
06:02:50.820 our schools have taught our children and
06:02:52.980 youth the value of Justice empathy and
06:02:55.378 kindness naturally our youth believe
06:02:58.020 that the Dignity of every single parents
06:03:00.660 matters
06:03:01.920 therefore we should not be surprised
06:03:03.660 about you think about that the
06:03:05.638 provisions of 377a are innately
06:03:08.218 discriminatory even if they are not
06:03:10.378 enforced by the government
06:03:12.660 so should we be surprised that our youth
06:03:15.480 can empathize with the lived experience
06:03:17.160 of the gay community some of whom have
06:03:19.620 experienced real or perceived
06:03:21.240 discrimination
06:03:22.320 no we should not
06:03:24.120 at the same time while Singapore and
06:03:26.400 youth respect diversity they also
06:03:28.500 continue to uphold the sensibility of a
06:03:30.540 traditional Society
06:03:32.160 they are pro-family and most believed
06:03:34.558 marriage is best defined as between a
06:03:36.840 man and a woman
06:03:38.400 therefore with regards to family the
06:03:40.860 views are not that different from the
06:03:42.900 generations of fingerprints before them
06:03:45.718 most of them have grown up with loving
06:03:47.878 parents grandparents and under the
06:03:50.280 nurturing shade of our family-centric
06:03:52.080 policies
06:03:53.160 they therefore intuitively understand
06:03:55.500 the importance of families not just for
06:03:58.020 themselves but also for society
06:04:01.378 at the same time
06:04:02.878 many youths also wondered why it took
06:04:04.980 Society so long to repeat 377a
06:04:08.520 however they have now observed the
06:04:10.920 painstaking consensus building effort
06:04:13.558 needed to move Singapore along
06:04:15.540 and because our youth can empathize with
06:04:17.458 differing viewpoints our youth now have
06:04:19.500 a deeper sense of understanding of how a
06:04:21.780 more traditional singaporeans feel
06:04:24.120 therefore I believe that most of our
06:04:26.218 youth will support the Amendments
06:04:27.958 proposed today
06:04:29.638 to sum up our youth does not see the
06:04:32.580 repeal of 377a or their belief that all
06:04:36.240 Singaporean matters as contradictory to
06:04:39.660 the approved family stance the views are
06:04:42.840 reasonable and we should listen to them
06:04:46.260 next I'd like to talk about how we can
06:04:48.360 best support our youth on this issue
06:04:49.920 especially on the one hand our youth who
06:04:51.958 are gay and worried that they will be
06:04:53.280 ostracized and on the other hand of you
06:04:55.620 who are worried about being canceled for
06:04:57.540 voicing in a respectful manner that
06:04:59.878 traditional Family Values
06:05:02.820 indeed we must take pains to ensure that
06:05:05.400 our schools remain neutral on this issue
06:05:07.500 and support both types of Youth in the
06:05:10.440 effective and low-key manner
06:05:12.840 I've observed that for a minority of
06:05:14.940 Youth there's a certain fluidity and
06:05:17.400 gender self-identification
06:05:19.558 a youth might identify himself as gay at
06:05:21.958 a certain age but have a different take
06:05:24.120 years later
06:05:25.500 and the reverse can also be true
06:05:27.958 therefore our school should neither
06:05:30.180 celebrate or ostracize our youth for
06:05:32.520 being gay
06:05:33.540 our schools should not let gender become
06:05:35.760 the defining attribute of who a person
06:05:37.620 is because if this issue gets polarized
06:05:40.320 we'll be robbing them opportunity to do
06:05:43.080 an authentic self-evaluation in their
06:05:45.360 formative years of who they truly are
06:05:49.200 we must also remember that for a small
06:05:51.780 country if our children and youth are
06:05:54.298 fiercely divided along any issues and
06:05:57.058 then they grow up within the confines of
06:05:58.920 those fault lines The Divide is not just
06:06:01.200 ideological
06:06:02.400 it can get deeply personal remember we
06:06:05.400 are a small country
06:06:06.480 frequently The Divide will have a human
06:06:08.638 face attached to that divide
06:06:12.240 and in my discussion with many teachers
06:06:14.400 and school leaders I believe our primary
06:06:16.558 secondary school and JC leaders have
06:06:18.718 done a good job in keeping our schools
06:06:21.298 neutral
06:06:23.100 they have taken a child-centric approach
06:06:25.020 to providing quiet and effective support
06:06:26.820 to our youth and compared to other
06:06:29.100 countries they've been quite successful
06:06:31.080 in preventing Educators from injecting
06:06:33.360 their Personal Agenda into the classroom
06:06:36.780 but it has been a while since we have
06:06:38.820 lost a debate on this issue so it's best
06:06:41.580 if Moe can remind our school leaders and
06:06:43.740 teachers on this and fingerprints will
06:06:45.780 also appreciate it if Amway can really
06:06:47.520 trade their Firm Stance on this matter
06:06:51.058 the situation in our tertiary Institute
06:06:53.160 is more complex
06:06:55.020 at that age our youth at the discovery
06:06:58.020 stage in their lives and now Educators
06:06:59.700 have a lot less influence over the
06:07:01.620 students
06:07:03.000 therefore I hope we can consider
06:07:05.040 legislations moving forward to prevent
06:07:06.900 cancer culture from taking root in
06:07:09.058 Singapore
06:07:10.620 let me now conclude Mr Speaker
06:07:12.958 I stand in support of the proposed
06:07:15.120 amendments because they are the result
06:07:16.740 of a painstaking consensus building
06:07:18.780 effort thereby cementing a common ground
06:07:21.480 into law
06:07:22.980 and also because they refresh our social
06:07:25.200 compact on gender and marriage for the
06:07:27.000 years ahead thereby addressing the very
06:07:29.458 reasonable concerns of more traditional
06:07:31.320 singaporeans and because it helps us
06:07:34.260 move Singapore forward thank you
