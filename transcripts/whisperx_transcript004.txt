In this brand new season of the family affair, four families across Asia live with cameras for months. A super-sized Singapore family struggles to stretch the dollar. 

SPEAKER_06  31.026
When everything is multiplied by eight, then you really feel it. Even if two dollars increase or one dollar increase, it becomes eight dollars or sixteen dollars. Why does pizza have to be so expensive in Singapore? 

SPEAKER_04  45.893
In China and India, 

SPEAKER_03  48.054
teenage tantrums abound. What do you do in your mobile phone in the morning? What message do you need? 

SPEAKER_07  55.365
And over in Japan, singlehood burdens aging parents. From round-the-clock filming to secret confessions, 

SPEAKER_05  75.02
When I see the bank account, I reach the three digits. My wife asks me, how, 

SPEAKER_06  80.205
how. I don't like to fight. I want to be a young person. I don't want to fight. I just want to 

SPEAKER_04  89.875
die. Find out how these families keep it together. I 

SPEAKER_06  93.598
don't know how many times I haven't done anything. And how their lives are just like yours. The family affair. 

SPEAKER_07  127.604
Wake up! Wake up! 

SPEAKER_04  168.262
It's Saturday. Grandma Li Taixiu knows there's no school. But she wants 16-year-old Wen Ji-shuan up early to catch up on schoolwork. 

SPEAKER_06  181.601
My mother-in-law died in the middle of the night. She had to wake me up in the morning. I was so worried about her. Did you hear that? I can't take my eyes off you. I can't take my eyes off you. Oh, my goodness. I was too young to get up in the morning. I didn't have much time 

SPEAKER_07  203.092
in the high school. I didn't know much about it. 

SPEAKER_06  209.625
Over in India, it's the school holidays. 

SPEAKER_04  235.455
But father of the Sharma household, Vipin, wants his 15-year-old son, Divyanshu, to help out with household 

SPEAKER_06  243.1
chores. 

SPEAKER_04  252.487
It's the start of another 18-hour workday for 29-year-old Haruka. She works as a sports TV producer in Tokyo. Working weekends is par for the course. 

SPEAKER_07  267.492
It's not like I'm working too hard. 

SPEAKER_06  281.3
I'm a bit shy, but he's also a bit of a lazy person. I say lazy, but he's not lazy. He doesn't say that I'm lazy in my dreams, but he's lazy in my old days. Every week, my mom will let me pack my clothes. But I've never really packed my clothes before. Basically, it's all good to have people in. So I can't really find my clothes now. Well, not everyone agrees with Ji Xuan's fashion sense. 

SPEAKER_07  335.379
It's hard to tell. But Grandma Li Dai Xu and Ji Xuan used to be very 

SPEAKER_06  340.223
close. 

SPEAKER_04  364.454
with both her parents working, Tixuan was raised by her grandmother. She 

SPEAKER_06  366.335
was 

SPEAKER_04  366.415
raised by her grandmother. She was raised by her grandmother. She was raised by her grandmother. She was raised by

Brother, did you paste it? Yes. So you came back and slept? It's amazing. Come on, get up and get ready. You have to go to the shop too. Son, don't you look at me at night, do you? Let me know when you wake up. Did you see the time? How much time has passed? Breakfast are a lot quieter at the 

SPEAKER_06  415.011
Saito household. 

SPEAKER_07  444.65
Meet Haruka's 

SPEAKER_00  446.271
mother, 

SPEAKER_04  448.373
58-year-old Yumiko Saito. Haruka is constantly occupied with work, leaving mother Yumiko feeling rather neglected. 

SPEAKER_07  491.882
Haruka, do you eat at home? Yes. Do you eat at home? Yes. What time do you come home? Around 9. 

SPEAKER_04  520.745
For the last 30 years, Yumiko has been a housewife. She married Sakai Chisaito when she was 28. Within the first two years, she had three children, Ryoya, Haruka, and Yuka. 

SPEAKER_06  539.216
In the last few years, much has changed. 

SPEAKER_04  551.909
Her youngest, Yuka, is married with two children and has moved out. Like most Japanese employees, her two other children, Haruka and Ryoya, work extremely long hours. Even her husband, who's now the director of a real estate company, is also hardly ever at home. 

SPEAKER_06  580.37
In India, Vipin gave up his career as a mechanical engineer. 

SPEAKER_04  610.103
focus on caring for his children. 

SPEAKER_06  640.314
Five months ago, Wipin was forced to leave his job. 

SPEAKER_04  666.673
His wife, Uma, who was suffering from a rare muscle disorder, passed away. 

SPEAKER_03  675.017
The kids used to tell me about their problems. They used to tell me about their problems. Now there's no one to take care of them. The communication between the two was cut off. 

SPEAKER_06  691.928
I used to tell my parents or sometimes I used to tell them to not scold them like that. La la la la. 

SPEAKER_00  718.669
When 48-year-old Dan and Sue tied the knot, they planned to have kids. But what they didn't plan on was having six of 

SPEAKER_04  725.953
them. 

SPEAKER_05  754.861
When I tell people that I have six kids, that's very unusual. 

SPEAKER_06  765.623
I tell people that if on my wedding day, I knew that I was going to have six children, I would probably have run away screaming. 

SPEAKER_04  776.205
Meet the oldest of the brood. 

SPEAKER_00  778.026
Hello, everybody. Hello. My name's Asher. 18-year-old Asher. I'm Isaac. This is my 

SPEAKER_04  785.882
brother, Isaac. Then there's 14-year-old Isaac, 16-year-old Abigail, 12-year-old Isaiah, 9-year-old Magdalena, and the baby of the family, 6-year-old Michaela. 

SPEAKER_06  802.336
Welcome to our house. This is our house. It's a five-room HDB flat. 

SPEAKER_04  809.542
With some clever space-saving tips, The 1400 square foot home fits all eight of them comfortably. 

SPEAKER_06  817.89
My friend took a look at our shelves and said it looks like a childcare centre. You know the little shelves and all the shoes down there. This is my family. So this is actually the master bedroom. The girls live here and this is a really cool bed that we can actually lift up and it doubles as their workspace. This living room space, we can double it up as a bedroom. Actually, the boys sleep here. We gave the largest room to the children and my husband and I actually took the smallest room for ourselves. 

SPEAKER_04  855.307
This is Su and Dan's bedroom. But most of the time, the entire Ong family squeezes into this room. 

SPEAKER_06  864.625
Everybody, squeeze in one room, we'll just lay out mattresses on the floor, and then we'll just turn on the air-cond and eat people enjoying. After Asha was born, I think my maternal instincts were very strong. How was your day? I don't know. It was really tiring. I couldn't bear the thought that somebody else would be caring for him full-time whilst I was at work. Long story short, I quit my job. 

SPEAKER_04  900.181
Su no longer works as a school teacher, leaving Dan the sole breadwinner. He supports his family of eight with a monthly income of less than US$4,000. So utilities aside, feeding the family requires quite a bit of planning. Half of the Ong's monthly budget goes to food alone. 

SPEAKER_06  932.994
Our monthly budget looks like a lot is spent on food because of eight mouths. Yeah, we eat quite a 

SPEAKER_07  939.841
lot. 

SPEAKER_06  947.508
Always buy two bunches, okay? Because we are the equivalent of two small families. Right? But this is like for one small family, so this is our family. Yeah, bye-bye. What are you going 

SPEAKER_07  966.551
to buy the yogurt? 4 

SPEAKER_06  968.751
for $2. 4 for $2 then get more lah. Avocado. 3 for $3.95. It's quite a good price. Can we have papaya? Papaya? I think we can get. The whole papaya. Living in Singapore, food prices have already gone up. Okay. 160 is... When everything is multiplied by 8, then you really feel it. Even if $2 increase or $1 increase, it becomes $8 or $16. Why does pizza have to be so expensive in Singapore? We don't go to restaurants to eat, you know. I'll try to learn new dishes so that we can actually enjoy restaurant food at home, and we don't feel... and we can eat a lot more. The bear has lost my face. Every night, I fall from the bed. At 16, Wang Qixuan is the only child of this middle-income family. I was a little bit confused when I was young. But when they told me that I was a little bit less than I thought I was, I was a little bit less than I thought. That was the one I liked the most. When I grew up, I was happy. When I grew up, my parents wouldn't care about me. 

SPEAKER_04  1091.789
Jishwen only comes back from boarding school on Saturdays. That's when her parents check on the progress of her other lessons. 

SPEAKER_06  1113.473
Even before 

SPEAKER_02  1114.274
she started school, 

SPEAKER_06  1115.455

You didn't listen to them? Is there a problem? Of course. We have to talk about it. If I don't talk to him, he will start to get angry. If he gets angry, I don't want to talk to him. If I talk to him, he will get angry. I don't want to talk to him. Can you communicate with us? Do you want to talk to each other? Why do you think it's the same thing? It's all the same thing. We're trying to understand each other's thoughts, okay? You know, when we understand each 

SPEAKER_02  1221.95
other, we 

SPEAKER_06  1222.27
start to get angry. You can't stop talking to him. You want to talk to him. But he doesn't want to accept it at all. He just wants to talk to you. He wants to buy a house and go to his wife. It's all because of him. It's all because of him. It's not interesting at all, okay? But you can't say it doesn't exist. Right? They're all the same. They're all the same. They're all the same. I'm just like them. I'm just like them. I'm just like them. I'm just like them. I'm just like them. I'm just like them. I'm just like them. I'm just like them. I'm just like them. I'm just like them.

Xuan's parents are frustrated with her lack of discipline. She said dancing, music and calligraphy lessons. But she's given up on all of them. 

SPEAKER_06  1375.924
Hello everyone, I'm from Chongqing Foreign Language School. I'm a former vice president. You can call me Shirley. I'm now Chongqing Bento. I'm a rapper for Music. Thank you. I wear a mask and pretend that you're not happy with me. The 

SPEAKER_01  1391.059
wind 

SPEAKER_06  1391.279
blows in my face, the lightning strikes my waist. I want to meet you with a smile. Sheha is a kind of anti-truth thing. She's more self-confident. I think sheha is more self-confident when she's with me. Hip-hop. This is what Ji Xuan truly loves. But it's not what her parents want for her. I think it's such a shame. When people see your state, it should be the most valuable, the most valuable. I'm most happy. I'm going home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In the coming year, Ji Xuan will take the highly competitive college entrance exam. 

SPEAKER_04  1501.53
But her grades are slipping. Mother Hua Ying is worried. 

SPEAKER_06  1512.995
I think you've grown up, but you haven't. And when she shows up recently, our characters are a little bit different. We think there's a dialogue between the characters. I'm afraid you still have to have a plan for your future. Or have some ideas. I don't know what you think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think.

think. I don't know what to think. I don't 

SPEAKER_00  1556.629
know what 

SPEAKER_06  1557.029
to think. I don't like to fight. I love my sister the 

SPEAKER_01  1575.644
most. Before that, I 

SPEAKER_06  1579.686
was more connected to my mother. After her death, my sister takes more care of me. 

SPEAKER_04  1593.556
Nineteen-year-old Purnima is a sophomore in university. She's had to run the household and take care of brother Divyanshu, ever since her mother passed away five months ago. 

SPEAKER_06  1619.722
It's a combination of the two. Even though she's still a child, she's still younger than me. So, until Purnima comes, she'll take care of 

SPEAKER_01  1633.085
her. When she goes, she'll get married and then she'll grow 

SPEAKER_03  1637.126
up. What are you saying? 

SPEAKER_04  1654.175
Divyanshu is back from English tuition. It's his weaker subject and Puneema wants him to buck up. 

SPEAKER_06  1684.68
When she was younger, she would teach her mom. She used to teach her mom that she was not strict. She didn't scold her much. She was so good at writing and writing. She was a little scared of me. She didn't scold her much. Do you understand yourself or something else? I understand. No, I don't. 

SPEAKER_01  1712.625
I 

SPEAKER_06  1712.665
don't know how bad it is. Okay. I won't come to play 

SPEAKER_00  1714.947
after doing 

SPEAKER_06  1715.788
this. Don't play. Go for half an hour. Just play. Half an hour. How much longer? Half an hour takes you to the moon. Where do you go to play? To the street. To the clock. Yes, sometimes they don't send me home, so I have to take it out on the ball. No, he doesn't share his feelings as soon as possible. He keeps telling me to study every time. And sometimes he doesn't send me home. I get angry. The more you get angry, the more you 

SPEAKER_01  1772.182
get mad. 

SPEAKER_00  1779.464
I'm trying to spell here. Laurie Lucas. 

SPEAKER_04  1787.846
In the Ong family, the six children have to share four mobile phones and two computers. I think 

SPEAKER_06  1797.024
it's double C. 

SPEAKER_04  1798.225
I'm not so sure. 

SPEAKER_06  1799.546
See this? 

SPEAKER_00  1800.467
Yeah, but it's wrong. I think 

SPEAKER_06  1812.436
it's A. 

SPEAKER_00  1813.637
Oh, yeah? Is it? You're such a brilliant kid. 

SPEAKER_06  1817.419
I know. Meg! What? You're not supposed to watch by yourself. Yeah. Come, come outside. We are very strict about the use of internet, especially the content. We go on a basis of not trusting. and especially they're not supposed to be online on their own. All screens of the laptop or the computer should be facing outwards, so that anybody who is walking by can see what's on the screen. What happens when you come across a scene and somebody is kissing? Then we don't watch that. We don't watch that scene anymore. None of the kids have actually stepped into a cinema before. Being the eldest, 

SPEAKER_00  1879.653
18-year-old Asha is given the most freedom. He's allowed to use the phone more. 

SPEAKER_04  1900.598
compared to his siblings, who only get one hour of screen time daily. Being 18 years old is about the time where I'm 

SPEAKER_05  1907.882
supposed to be able to take care of myself. 

SPEAKER_00  1910.604
I'm going to 

SPEAKER_05  1911.044
Instagram Live later. Nobody's on Facebook. 

SPEAKER_00  1913.525
I mean, I don't know how many people are going to view it, but who cares? Checking connection. 

SPEAKER_04  1925.723
Only the oldest two in the family, Asher and Abigail, are allowed their own social media accounts. 

SPEAKER_00  1933.447
Okay, come on guys. Oh, hello again! So just tell me something. While I edit my work, what's my inspiration for my photos? One of the biggest Instagram accounts that I really like is YK, the blue colour guy. 

SPEAKER_06  1952.977
He really makes really cool stuff. 

SPEAKER_00  1955.445
I feel that he spends way too much time on the screen. This is the first time that Asher is live streaming. 

SPEAKER_04  1984.557
and his curious younger siblings are drawn in. I 

SPEAKER_06  1989.96
was noticing that the nine-year-old Mac, she was talking quite a lot, so I don't know what she would say wrong or anything like that, and revealing too much of personal information on the web. I'm going to tell Asher to please stop it soon. I'm not sure if 

SPEAKER_01  2009.251
we 

SPEAKER_06  2009.551
didn't have any news about this. We haven't talked about this. 

SPEAKER_01  2014.952
Is it wrong? It might 

SPEAKER_06  2018.775
be wrong. Why? I really didn't know that you were going to go live. As parents, we need to be very vigilant about what our children are doing online. 

SPEAKER_00  2028.422
Just 

SPEAKER_06  2028.622
whatever goes online inevitably will never go away. And you have your younger siblings on you know. As a parent, it is difficult for me to navigate the amount of control, especially when I'm trying to juggle different age groups. 

SPEAKER_04  2094.873
It's only been six months since Haruka took up a new job as a sports TV producer in Tokyo. But an upcoming global sports event is about to make Haruka's life more hectic. 

SPEAKER_02  2108.461
The Games of the 32nd Olympiad in 2020 are awarded to the city of Tokyo! The 2020 

SPEAKER_06  2116.108
Summer Olympics are in Tokyo! I don't want to be like this. We have a tournament next month. Can you tell us about it? How did you feel last year? 

SPEAKER_04  2141.778
With more experienced producers vying to be part of the prestigious event, the competition will be brutal. 

SPEAKER_07  2149.366
I have to win in many directors who are limited. I have to be able to go outside without getting caught. I have to make such a machine myself, but I can't make it. 

SPEAKER_06  2166.887
I don't have a day off, so I had a lot of time with my friends and family. For 

SPEAKER_07  2170.031
example, I had a chance to have a boyfriend, so I couldn't spend time with him. 

SPEAKER_06  2190.219
to understand how my dad works. That's how I became a part of the family. That's how I became a part of the family. That's how I became a part of the family. Now that I'm working, Of course, there are people who can't go home. I'm home. I'm home. Are you going to wash your hands tomorrow too? I don't know. I don't think I'm going to be able to wash my hands. I'm not going to be able 

SPEAKER_07  2252.289
to wash my hands. I'm not going to be able to wash my hands. I don't think I'm going to be able to wash my hands. I don't think I'm going to be able to wash my hands. I don't think I'm going to be able to wash my hands. I don't think I'm going to be able to wash my hands. I 

SPEAKER_06  2267.053
don't think I'm going to be able to wash my hands. I don't think I'm going to be able to wash my hands. I don't think I'm going to be able to wash my hands. I don't think I'm going to be able 

SPEAKER_07  2275.476
to wash my hands. When she's tired from work or when she has a hard time working, she 

SPEAKER_06  2280.037
can talk to me whenever she wants, but she can't talk to me. When I become a social worker, 

SPEAKER_07  2305.566
I'm a very 

SPEAKER_06  2306.246
busy person, and I'm almost like the head of the industry. I'm going to put in a cup of tea and talk to them in a calm manner. I feel that there is a sense of value, a way of thinking, and a way of capturing things. 

SPEAKER_04  2336.846
Monday morning, as the rest of Singapore's children head to school, at the Ong household, the children head to their study room. The children are home schooled. 

SPEAKER_06  2354.913
Our kids don't go to public school. We actually educate them at home. Maybe some doubts from the elder generation, like Dan's mum also was quite fearful by their doing fine. The fact that both Dan and I were trained MOE teachers and choosing to homeschool actually is not because we have any commentary about the public school system. but more so because we want to take charge of our own children's education and having the autonomy to grow our children the way that we deem fit. 

SPEAKER_04  2428.129
Su decides the children's curriculum, but is otherwise quite free and easy about the timetable. In the Ong household, school generally starts after 8am. The children set their own goals and tasks for the 

SPEAKER_01  2444.266
day. 

SPEAKER_04  2447.827
The next two to three hours are spent doing lessons online. 

SPEAKER_06  2453.628
They can do their own work while I have to cook lunch or sometimes I'm doing the laundry. It's really the book that teaches them and I come in as a guide. 

SPEAKER_04  2476.928
The afternoons are spent playing and practicing music. 

SPEAKER_06  2488.655
Yeah, I really like homeschooling because I don't like to go outside. I don't like traveling. Do you feel like we are like other people wearing uniform and then you never wear? I don't like wearing the same thing every day. Quite boring. You still wear the same thing every day, right? Yeah. Do you think you're gonna study at home forever? 

SPEAKER_01  2513.94
No. 

SPEAKER_06  2514.22
Then when do you think you're gonna go to school? 

SPEAKER_01  2516.381
Probably. 

SPEAKER_06  2518.154
You want to go poly? 

SPEAKER_01  2519.355
No. 

SPEAKER_06  2520.776
Then why do you think

you're going to school? Because I have to grow up anyway.

In Singapore, homeschooling is allowed only if a child passes the primary school leaving examination, or PSLE, before 15 years old. 

SPEAKER_06  2543.88
I think only on levels, which is like grade 10. I don't 

SPEAKER_01  2547.921
want to go to university. I want to stay home forever. But that's 

SPEAKER_06  2553.002
just what you're thinking now. Like when you get that age, you wouldn't think you want to stay home forever. Yeah. But now I want to stay. Can I take it out? No! If our children don't pass the PSLE, we would not be able to continue homeschooling them and they would be placed in a primary school.

Passing isn't enough. There's a minimum standard that they have to reach. And that's why fourth child, Isaiah, is feeling the heat. He will be taking his PSLE later in the year. 

SPEAKER_06  2590.318
Chinese PSLE, you have to do oral. The subject I was really scared of was tennis. Because I can't speak Chinese and I can't write Chinese. I do know a bit but I'm not very good.

Isaiah's three older siblings did not meet the benchmark on their first try. 

SPEAKER_06  2618.311
They all managed to clear at the second attempt. We have a different curriculum that we're using. So to suddenly get them to the PSLE track is kind of a switch for them. Mummy sometimes say we have to go this good if we fail. Just to scare us a little. Sometimes it terrifies me. 

SPEAKER_04  2648.274
The exams are in three months, and this will be Isaiah's second attempt. 

SPEAKER_06  2655.08
If Isaiah still doesn't make the grade, he will have to return to a mainstream school. That would make me very sad now.
