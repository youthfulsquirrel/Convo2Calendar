SPEAKER_00  1.192
for the first time on television. Five families on welfare in Singapore open up their lives to our cameras. 

SPEAKER_06  12.537
Over four months, we filmed in Bukit Merah, home to some 

SPEAKER_00  15.058
of the neediest people in Singapore. We follow our families through crises. 

SPEAKER_09  33.872
Twins only left for 

SPEAKER_03  35.173
one bottle for one baby only. 

SPEAKER_06  43.981
I just wanted to get out from this place. 

SPEAKER_00  46.703
And see them through hope. 

SPEAKER_01  49.165
Today, we've got work, we've got money. 

SPEAKER_00  57.338
This is life at the bottom, as you've never seen 

SPEAKER_08  60.299
before. 

SPEAKER_00  64.902
Previously on Don't Call Us Poor, Hong Chuan Chuan struggles with a new baby. Hong Chuan Chuan lives in a one-room public rental flat in Bukit Merah. 

SPEAKER_03  88.69
Chuan Chuan is doing what she can to make space. This double-decker bed was donated by a friend. The place has become very narrow. When I walk here, it will affect my husband's sleep. He will feel uncomfortable. Why is it so messy? Because I want to say something now. To be honest, most of these things are hers. She brought back the things she liked. She didn't want me to mess with her. You have to ask her first. If you don't ask her, she'll say, okay, you can throw it away. But if you don't do that, what will people do? She's unhappy, to 

SPEAKER_01  137.852
be honest. She's unhappy. 

SPEAKER_00  150.882
Twice a week, Chuan Chuan's husband Sky runs a karaoke session for senior citizens of Bukit Merah. He's paid $100 a month. Sky has a second part-time job in the same fast-food restaurant as Chuan Chuan. Together, they take home $1,000 Singapore dollars a month, barely enough to cover half their expenses. So, Chuan Chuan's parents have to step in. 

SPEAKER_08  177.967
My income has helped us a lot. He would give us some allowance every day. Besides that, he would cover our income. How much 

SPEAKER_13  190.792
did he give 

SPEAKER_08  192.893
us? About six per month. So every day is about 20. Both of us feel very bad. But at this present moment, we still can't stop. Because one thing is that I like to sing. So over here, I'm singing for free. 

SPEAKER_00  239.329
Over at Spooner Road, on the edge of Bukit Merah, Maslinda and Hanafi are starting their day. Hanafi works at the container port. The hours are long and there's no guarantee of work. It all depends on the schedule of the cargo ships. Each day starts with a phone call to the office. 

SPEAKER_01  264.615
Hello. 

SPEAKER_00  282.556
The family needs every centre Nafi can earn. Maslinda has seven children, two already grown up, but the other five are still very young. The eldest among them, Firman, is eight. The youngest, Hakaf, is only one week old. Mazlinda quit her job as a cashier two years ago when she was pregnant with twins, Haifi and Haifa. Now, she needs a job more than ever. But she's worried about finding someone who can watch over her kids while she's at work. 

SPEAKER_09  316.354
If you care more, better. Because FAC, they pay for me. So I need to pay them only $5 only for one child. So I can afford $5. You see, I put in people's house, I put it in my neighbour's house. At least I have to pay at least $200 for three. I got a job for $600 or $700. Then the milk, I have to buy. Rappers, I have to send them also. Easily some more, I need to plow my handphone. So I also think about it. All the money, the money. 

SPEAKER_00  372.332
Hong Chuan Chuan has just seen her gynecologist for a prenatal checkup. Her due date is a few weeks away. 

SPEAKER_03  378.894
Even a simple phone call with her husband Skye can lead to a fight. We don't know how to deal with it. So we have to deal with it. Why are you doing this? I don't know how to deal with it. What are you doing? 

SPEAKER_04  419.542
How many do you mean? How many do you mean? 

SPEAKER_03  423.764
How many do you mean? I feel like 

SPEAKER_12  449.864
I'm helping someone else that way. Wow! Hey, it looks like it's done. Yes, 

SPEAKER_04  457.187
you 

SPEAKER_11  457.547
will be 

SPEAKER_12  457.988
eating it then. Do you know what you're doing? Do you 

SPEAKER_04  467.892
know what? 

SPEAKER_03  469.832
Do you know what? Do you know 

SPEAKER_06  471.533
what? Do 

SPEAKER_04  471.973
you know 

SPEAKER_06  472.914
what? 

SPEAKER_03  483.339
Yes. Sometimes I feel like I'm going through a hard time. You don't know how old she is. She's just kidding. Are you ready? Are you all ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? 

SPEAKER_12  497.007
Are you ready? Are

SPEAKER_12  503.991
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? 

SPEAKER_03  512.984
Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, 

SPEAKER_08  523.927
Jeremy. Thank you, Jeremy. 

SPEAKER_00  560.659
With a new baby on the way and no stable source of income, Hung Chuan Chuan needs all the help she can get. She's come to the book at Mera's social service office to see what can be done for her family. The family currently receives about $150 in cash a month from the government. as well as a waiver on rent and conservancy fees. But the assistance runs out in February, and today, Chuan Chuan is applying to get it extended. Her officer-in-charge is Esther Ho. 

SPEAKER_03  601.255
If she doesn't want to stress him further, he earns 

SPEAKER_10  604.677
whatever he can, then, I mean, to her it's enough. To me, it 

SPEAKER_03  608.179
may not be. So this differing kind of views, 

SPEAKER_00  625.588
We cannot 

SPEAKER_10  625.929
debate about, because these people are truly in need of help. Yet we want to give them lesser, penalise them just because of the husband. It's not going to benefit the family. 

SPEAKER_00  638.497
But Esther has a bigger concern. 

SPEAKER_10  641.439
And I first met Chuan Chuan here last December. So I saw some bruises on her face and some... marks on her hand, then I asked her. Then she said, she fell down. I said, if you fell, you can't be hitting against your eye here and then bruise so badly. Then she said, she just kept quiet for quite a while. Then I just asked her, did your husband meet you? Then she said, yeah. She didn't want me to tell any agency or refer her to anywhere. She just says she can cope. She knows how to manage her husband's temper. 

SPEAKER_00  683.162
It doesn't take much to light the fuse on Skye's quick-fire 

SPEAKER_13  686.685
temper. 

SPEAKER_00  690.007
We were shooting with the family when their drunk neighbours started to complain loudly about them. 

SPEAKER_08  704.98
Eventually, the police were called in, and the fight broke out. Because my wife is very understanding. The only thing is that she's stubborn. So when you go to a hot temple and meet a stubborn person, that's it. 

SPEAKER_03  746.28
It takes a long time to get to know her. But the things she does, her thoughts and the things she says, it gives you an impression. Your impression is a very difficult moment. I would like to give the child a complete home. Although it is not the best, it is not the most beautiful one. But at least it is still complete. 

SPEAKER_00  804.689
For ten years, Chuan Chuan kept the physical and emotional trauma a secret. Eventually, with the help of a social worker, she obtained a personal protection order against her husband. With this document, a further attack from Skye could land him in jail. Sky consented to the personal protection order in 2010, and since then, Chuan Chuan has used it twice. The first time, Sky received a police warning, but that didn't stop him. A few months later, he beat Chuan Chuan again, this time with a metal rod. 

SPEAKER_03  874.98
Why did you say 

SPEAKER_02  880.262
that? 

SPEAKER_08  883.343
I don't know. I know it's not a big deal. It's just that... I was triggered. I was triggered. Then he said, I don't know. Don't let me participate. If I don't, I'll continue. Since you continue to meet something like a challenge, I'll... So, I mean, when I breach a PPO, I know what I'm going to get. To me, since it's a challenge, why should I mind so much? 

SPEAKER_00  914.669
For violating the personal protection order a second time, Skye was sent to jail. I 

SPEAKER_03  924.216
was only three weeks old. When I went to the hospital, I was very disappointed. I felt 

SPEAKER_00  947.264
Tonight, the girls are staying with their grandparents. Their mother, Chuan Chuan, is in labour. 

SPEAKER_03  961.977
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's 

SPEAKER_07  966.8
wrong? 

SPEAKER_03  967.861
What's wrong? What's 

SPEAKER_07  969.582
wrong? What's wrong? 

SPEAKER_03  970.723
What's wrong? 

SPEAKER_07  971.603
What's wrong? 

SPEAKER_04  989.926
I can't speak Chinese. I can only speak 

SPEAKER_07  991.608
Chinese. It's very hard. Do you feel a little bit like this? 

SPEAKER_09  995.151
Do you feel a little bit like this? Do you feel a little bit like this? Do you feel a little bit like this? Do you feel a little bit like this? Do you 

SPEAKER_07  999.576
feel a little bit like this? Do you feel a little bit like this? Do you feel a little bit like this? Do you feel a little bit like this? Do you feel a little bit like this? 

SPEAKER_10  1015.441
My main concern is the kind of environment that the family is providing for their children. 

SPEAKER_00  1040.109
This is Anson Kwek, only two weeks old and already the darling of his sisters. With the increase in expenses, their dad, Skye, has been taking more shifts at the fast-food restaurant. 

SPEAKER_10  1055.124
How was Skye recently? Has he 

SPEAKER_03  1058.307
been feeling better? He's much better. Every time he comes back, he helps me sleep. I was hoping for a new start. I didn't have any special 

SPEAKER_07  1073.284
requirements 

SPEAKER_03  1078.109
for my husband. I just felt comfortable and innocent. That's how it was. When did you feel that you liked this person? I felt it. It was a kind of feeling. When I felt it, I felt it. In fact, he's quite kind, but he has bad temper. He forgets everything when he has a temper. 

SPEAKER_00  1117.13
When we went back a few days later, the situation was much less rosy. The atmosphere was tense. My main concern... 

SPEAKER_10  1133.291
It's the kind of environment that the family is providing for their children. So there are two ways they can learn. They can learn to be their mother, to be passive. They can learn from their father to be abusive. 

SPEAKER_00  1145.174
This is the Student Care Centre, where Lebel Kwak and her older sister Isabel spend their time after school. They enrolled here two years ago on the recommendation of their social worker. 

SPEAKER_13  1158.583
She's 

SPEAKER_09  1160.524
not 

SPEAKER_13  1161.224
hurt, right? 

SPEAKER_03  1164.386
Is she your best 

SPEAKER_13  1164.966
friend? She's my normal friend. Last time, it was the best friend. Now, it's Jessica. 

SPEAKER_03  1170.789
Why is she your best friend last time, but now normal friend? 

SPEAKER_13  1174.17
Because last time, I made her pay. She was smart. Do 

SPEAKER_10  1181.634
you really 

SPEAKER_13  1182.334
want to be her teacher? They 

SPEAKER_02  1190.109
are rude. Very rough. And I can say, rudeness is the most part. And at least sometimes the kids, other children, all their classmates, don't like to friend with them. 

SPEAKER_13  1205.112
Why 

SPEAKER_11  1214.099
did you do this? 

SPEAKER_02  1218.463
Because I think she lacks... They lack self-amily love. 

SPEAKER_05  1223.207
She complained that sometimes her father would use a belt to frame her and even... After strangling her, she will use the bag and see where I'm going. So they are very afraid of her father and she's very afraid of her father. 

SPEAKER_00  1239.169
Chuan Chuan had tried in 2010 to apply for a personal protection order for her daughters. But the application was not approved because she could not produce any medical records or police reports. 

SPEAKER_03  1252.751
I can understand that they need to report to the police, because this is evidence. But sometimes it's not about the body. It's about the mind. It's about the mind. But the problem is about the mind. How am I going to find evidence? How am I going to find evidence to prove that his father did something wrong? I don't understand how he hurt their mind. 

SPEAKER_13  1281.929
Last time, my mother-in-law worked that time. Me and my sister 

SPEAKER_10  1287.452
were playing for a day, 

SPEAKER_08  1290.334
fight, fight, fight, fight until I started bashing most. Then her nose all black. 

SPEAKER_10  1311.112
Do you think beating someone as well? 

SPEAKER_12  1313.914
Yeah. But I had no choice. They made me super angry. 

SPEAKER_08  1317.837
When I was a kid, I loved to play. When I grew up, I was good at defending. Then you beat me and I beat you. To me, being violent is a way of protecting myself. You want to say that you're violent, It's something that I want. It's something that I'm going to go on. In the next episode of Don't Call Us Poor, Two women fighting for a second chance with their children. 

SPEAKER_06  1392.95
He's the only one that I have now, Abby. Whatever that I've already lost in the past, I want to make up with him back. How did 

SPEAKER_10  1403.955
you get trapped by your own circumstances? 

SPEAKER_03  1406.476
I was very stressed when you paid for 

SPEAKER_09  1410.538
it. 

SPEAKER_03  1410.858
I 

SPEAKER_09  1411.778
had a lot of children. I had a lot of budget. I didn't have any. What about the money? 

SPEAKER_04  1422.819
I think I'm a little less. I don't want to go to jail.
