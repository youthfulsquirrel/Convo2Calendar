      "Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse. Unterscheidung between data lakehouse and data warehouse is a common topic of discussion in the data engineering community, as both are designed to store large amounts of data but have different architectures, use cases, and benefits. A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all the raw data from various sources in its original form, without transforming or processing it. On the other hand, a data warehouse is a structured repository that organizes and transforms data into a specific schema for querying and analysis.\n",
      "Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:\n",
      "1. Data Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its raw, unprocessed form, while a data warehouse organizes data into a structured schema.\n",
      "2. Data Processing: A data lakehouse does not process data, whereas a data warehouse transforms and processes data to make it query-friendly.\n",
      "3. Data Scalability: A data lakehouse can handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster, while a data warehouse can become bottlenecked as the volume of data grows.\n",
      "4. Data Security: A data lakehouse provides better security features than a data warehouse since it stores data in its raw form, making it harder for unauthorized access.\n",
      "5. Data Governance: A data warehouse typically has a well-defined governance structure, which makes it easier to manage and maintain data quality, whereas a data lakehouse may require more effort to ensure data quality and governance.\n",
      "6. Cost: A data lakehouse can be less expensive than a data warehouse, especially when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
      "7. Use Cases: A data lakehouse is suitable for use cases that involve complex queries, real-time analytics, machine learning, and IoT data processing, while a data warehouse is better suited for traditional BI and reporting workloads.\n",
      "8. Data Integration: A data lakehouse integrates data from various sources and stores them in a single repository, making it easier to perform cross-data source analysis, whereas a data warehouse may require additional integration efforts to combine data from different sources.\n",
      "9. Data Lineage: A data lakehouse provides better data lineage capabilities than a data warehouse, enabling organizations to track the origin and history of their\n"
